Abstract
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), previously the National Crime Survey (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and
household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1972. The survey
is administered by the U.S. Census Bureau (under the U.S. Department of Commerce) on behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (under
the U.S. Department of Justice).
The NCS and NCVS were both designed with four primary objectives:
1.
2.
3.
4.

To develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime,
To estimate the numbers and types of crimes not reported to the police,
To provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and
To permit comparisons over time and types of areas.

Beginning in 1992 the NCVS categorizes crimes as "personal" or "property" covering the personal crimes of rape and sexual attack,
robbery, aggravated and simple assault and purse-snatching/ pocket-picking; and the property crimes of burglary, theft, and motor vehicle
theft. Beyond a simple count of victimizations, the NCVS gathers details on the incident itself insofar as the victim can report them. Such

-4-

- Study 34650 details include the month, time, and location of the crime, the relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender,
self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of
property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs,
and alcohol. Basic demographic information, such as age, race, gender, and income, is also collected to enable analysis of crime by
various sub-populations for select years. Information is also obtained on vandalism and identity theft experienced by the household. The
glossary (see p. 493) describes terms relevant to the NCVS.
Analysts who are interested in the history of the redesign of the NCVS or are interested in conducting analyses using both NCS and NCVS
data should refer to the NCVS Resource Guide (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS) on the NACJD Web site.

Notes
COMPARISONS ACROSS YEARS
Due to changes in survey methodology in 2006 that mainly affected rural areas, estimates for 2006 are not comparable to other years.
Therefore, care should be taken in interpreting results from 2006. See Criminal Victimization, 2006 Technical Notes for an explanation of
the changes to the survey and their impacts on estimates of crime.
Notes
DATA ANOMALY
NCVS Methodological Changes in 2006 and 2007
A number of methodological changes were implemented in the NCVS in 2006 that impacted the victimization rate estimates for that year.
These effects were reversed in 2007, suggesting that the 2006 findings represent a temporary anomaly in the data. The changes and
their impact upon the survey's estimates are described in Criminal Victimization 2006 Technical Notes, available online at
(http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf). A detailed discussion of the analyses of the 2007 data by BJS and the Census Bureau are
available in Criminal Victimization, 2007 at (http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv07.pdf).
The methodological changes implemented in 2006 that have been linked to the data anomaly include:
• The introduction of a new sample based on the 2000 decennial census;
• A transition from paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI) to computer-assisted interviewing (CAPI); and
• The use of first-time interviews in the new sample areas in the production of survey estimates.
In 2007, three additional changes were made largely for budgetary reasons to the NCVS program:
• The sample was reduced by 14% in July 2007;

-5-

- Study 34650 • First-time interviews from all sample areas were used in the production of 2007 estimates; and
• Computer-assisted interviews from centralized telephone centers were discontinued in July 2007.
Analyses of the 2007 estimates indicate that the program changes made in 2007 had relatively small impact on NCVS estimates. As
discussed in Criminal Victimization, 2006, the substantial increases in victimization rates from 2005 to 2006 do not appear to be due to
actual changes in crime during that period. BJS continues to work with the U.S. Census Bureau to better understand the impact of these
changes upon survey estimates. Based on research completed to date, there is a high degree of confidence that survey estimates for
2007 are consistent with and comparable to those for 2005 and with 2008 through the current year. While the estimates for 2007 are close
to the levels for 2005, they are substantially below the levels for 2006.
NCVS Sample Reinstatement
To restore the quality of the NCVS data, BJS and the U.S. Census Bureau (Census) implemented a sample reinstatement. The sample
reinstatement project was designed to restore sample cases that were cut in the mid-2000s due to budget constraints as a means of
improving the precision of the national victimization estimates. The sample size was returned to levels last seen in the late 1990s to
increase the precision of the estimates for crime. Beginning in October 2010, Census began restoring the sample to existing areas using
existing field representatives. The sample size increased approximately 24%, from about 8,500 households per month to 10,500. The
reinstatement was fully implemented by June 2011.
Notes
FORM AND CONTENT OF NCVS DATA FILES
The form and content of NCVS data files have changed over the years. A brief discussion of this is warranted. In particular, the concepts
of collection-year versus data-year format and bounded versus unbounded interviews affect the data.
Collection year versus data year
Historically the NCVS data files have been made available using the data-year format. Under the data-year format, crime incidents are
reported based on the year that the incident actually occurred. Thus, given that the NCVS employs a six month retrospective reference
period, 18 months of interviews are necessary to estimate a year of crime incidents. For example, a respondent interviewed in June, 2012
may indicate that a crime occurred in December, 2011. Under the data-year format that crime would be counted in 2011.
Under the collection-year format, crime incidents are reported based on when the interview was conducted, not when the crime occurred.
In the previous example the crime would be counted in 2012. Whereas the data-year format requires 18 months of interviews to estimate
crime incidents, the collection-year format requires only 12 months. Therefore, estimates of crime can be reported in a more timely fashion
under the collection-year format.
NCVS data files made available under the data-year format include all of the data that comprise the collection-year format. However, the
data-year format inherently results in delays in analyzing data and publishing results. All current BJS publications use the collection-year
format. Consequently, BJS has decided to release a collection-year version of the NCVS.
The NCVS data files have several variables that contain year information. Two of them are particularly important: V4015 (YEAR INCIDENT
OCCURRED) and YEARQ (YEAR AND QUARTER OF INTERVIEW). As their labels indicate they record different information. Under the
collection-year format V4015 will contain more than one year, and YEARQ will contain only one year (recorded as yyyy.q to indicate both
year and quarter of interview). The collection-year data files are prepared by using YEARQ to select records.
NCVS data collections with titles such as NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY, YYYY [RECORD-TYPE FILES] are data-year
format. Data collections with titles such as NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY, YYYY [COLLECTION YEAR RECORD-TYPE
FILES] are collection-year format.
Starting with 2009 data, the NCVS is being released in collection-year format only. The 2009 and forward data collections are titled:
NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY, YYYY.
Bounded versus Unbounded Interviews

-6-

- Study 34650 NCVS households are interviewed a total of seven times at six-month intervals over a three-year period. From 1992-2005 the first interview
was excluded from the traditional release of NCVS data (except for replacement households). The first interview is the bounding interview
and is used to control for respondent telescoping. It is used to place reported crime incidents in time to avoid reporting them again in
subsequent interviews. The traditional release of NCVS data files is bounded data-year files. This changed in 2006. The years 2006 and
2007 were a phase-in period when households new to the sample began having their first interviews included in the NCVS data files.
Starting in 2008 all new households have their first interview included in the data; the data are unbounded. Data collections titled: NATIONAL
CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY, YYYY [RECORD-TYPE FILES] are bounded for years 1992-2005; for 2006 and 2007 they are a mix
of bounded and unbounded interviews; and for 2008 and onward they are unbounded.
In anticipation of the NCVS data becoming unbounded, BJS made several years of NCVS data (1999-2006) available in unbounded format.
This allowed users interested in methodological issues to work with both forms of the data. These data collections are titled: NATIONAL
CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY: UNBOUNDED DATA, YYYY.
For years where there are both bounded and unbounded formats of NCVS data available, the unbounded data file will contain more
records. However, other than the additional records, the only difference between the unbounded data and the bounded data is the values
of the weight variables. The household, person, and incident weights have all been adjusted to reflect the larger number of records in the
unbounded file.
Weighted estimates of housing units and population are comparable in the unbounded and bounded data, although not exactly the same
because of rounding as the weights were recalculated. Crime victimizations estimated using the unbounded data will be higher than those
estimated using the regular NCVS because more reported incidents are included with the data.
Notes
RECORD-TYPE FILES
Data from the National Crime Victimization Surveys are now available from ICPSR in four record-type files: address, household, person,
and incident. Previously NCVS data were available in a hierarchical format containing four record types. The use of four record-type files
- each a rectangular file - simplifies the use of the data while maintaining all of the information and functionality present in the hierarchical
format.
The address and household record-type files contain information about the household as reported by the respondent and characteristics
of the surrounding area as computed by the Bureau of the Census. The person record-type file contains information about each household
member age 12 years and older as reported by that person or proxy, with one record for each qualifying individual. The incident record-type
file contains information drawn from the incident report completed for each household incident or person incident mentioned during the
interview.
ID variables have been added to the record-type files to facilitate merging the separate files. Each of the four record-type files contains
the variable YEARQ, which indicates the year and quarter an interview was conducted in, or was to be conducted in. This variable is
necessary because NCVS ID variables are unique only within each six-month interview period. The address record-type file is merged to
the household record-type file using YEARQ and IDHH (the household ID). The household record-type file is merged to the person
record-type file also using YEARQ and IDHH (the household ID). The person record-type file is merged to the incident record-type file
using YEARQ, IDHH (the household ID), and IDPER (the person ID). An example of matching the record-type files is included with this
documentation p. 540. The example demonstrates how to create the incident-level extract file included with this data collection.
In addition to the single-year record-type files contained in this data collection, separate data collections contain multi-year concatenated
incident-level extract files and multi-year concatenated rape subset extract files.

- Study 34650 Sampling Procedure:
Each month the U.S. Census Bureau selects respondents for the NCVS using a "rotating panel" sample design. Households are randomly
selected and all age-eligible individuals become part of the panel. Once in the sample, respondents are interviewed every six months for
a total of seven interviews over a three-year period. The first and fifth interviews are face-to-face; the rest are by telephone. After the
seventh interview the household leaves the panel and a new household is rotated in to the sample.
SAMPLE DESIGN
The NCVS sample consists of approximately 50,000 sample housing units selected with a stratified, multi-stage cluster design. The Primary
Sampling Units (PSUs) composing the first stage of the sample were counties, groups of counties, or large metropolitan areas. PSUs are
further grouped into strata. Large PSUs were included in the sample automatically and each is assigned its own stratum. These PSUs
are considered to be self-representing (SR) since all of them were selected. The remaining PSUs, called non-self-representing (NSR)
because only a subset of them was selected, were combined into strata by grouping PSUs with similar geographic and demographic
characteristics, as determined by the decennial Census used to design the sample.
The NCVS sample is drawn from the decennial census. At approximately mid-decade sample selection from the most recent census is
phased in. Prior to that, sample selection is based on the census before the most recent one. For example, prior to 1995, the sample was
drawn from the 1980 decennial Census. From January, 1995 until December, 1997, the sample drawn from the 1990 Census was phased
in. From January, 1998 until approximately 2005 the complete NCVS sample was drawn from the 1990 Census. In 2005 samples from
the 2000 Census began to be phased-in.
The NCVS sample has been revised to take advantage of the availability of data from the most recent census. Adjusted Population Controls
(i.e., age, sex, and race ratios derived from adjusted data based on the Undercount Post-Survey Enumeration data) were used for
post-stratification weighting.
The sample of housing units within a PSU was selected in two stages. These stages were designed to ensure a self-weighting probability
sample of housing units and group-quarters dwellings within each of the selected areas. (That is, prior to any weighting adjustments, each
sample housing unit had the same overall probability of being selected.) The first stage consisted of selecting a sample of Enumeration
Districts (EDs) from designated PSUs (EDs are established for each decennial census and are geographic areas ranging in size from a
city block to several hundred square miles, and usually encompassing a population of 750 to 1,500 persons.) EDs were systematically
selected proportionate to their size.
In the second stage, each selected ED was divided into segments (clusters of about four housing units each), and a sample of segments
was selected. The segments were formed from the list of addresses compiled during the relevant censuses. However, procedures allow
for the inclusion of housing constructed after each decennial Census enumeration. A sample of permits issued for the construction of new
residential housing is drawn, and for jurisdictions that do not issue building permits, small land-area segments are sampled. These
supplementary procedures, though yielding a relatively small portion of the total sample, enable persons living in housing units built after
each decennial Census to be properly represented in the survey. In addition, units in group quarters known as "special places" were also
selected in special place segments. These units, such as boarding houses and dormitories, constitute a small portion of the total sample.
The sample design results in the selection of about 50,000 housing units and other living quarters.
ROTATING PANEL DESIGN
Because of the continuing nature of the National Crime Victimization Survey, a rotation scheme was devised to avoid interviewing the
same household indefinitely. The sample of housing units is divided into six rotation groups, and each group is interviewed every six
months for a period of three years.
Within each of the six rotation groups, six panels are designated. A different panel is interviewed each month during the six-month period.
Until 2006 the first interview for a housing unit in a group was used only for bounding and was not included in the regular public use data.
However, if a new household moved into a sample unit, the members of that household were interviewed and their unbounded interviews
were included in the data. Thus, the number of incident reports associated with a household may be affected by its tenure in the sample.
New households will have unbounded information while older units may display "time in sample" effects. See p. 542 for an illustration of
the NCVS rotation scheme.
Mode of Data Collection: Telephone interviews, computer-aided telephone interviews, face-to-face interviews
Type of Research Instrument:

-8-

- Study 34650 Three basic forms are used to collect the required data for the National Crime Victimization Surveys. The control card contains the address
of each sample unit and the basic household data, such as the names of all persons living there and their age, race, sex, marital status,
education, etc. The basic screen questionnaire contains a set of questions used to elicit reports of crimes against the household and its
members. The crime incident report contains a set of questions used to gather details (e.g.: location of incident, relationship of victim to
offender, extent of injuries and/or economic loss) on crimes reported in the Basic Screen Questionnaire. These forms are described in
detail in the Glossary (see p. 493 under "Control Card", "Basic Screen Questionnaire", and "Incident Report"; also see Questionnaire Details
p. 549 for information on the NCVS questionnaire and interviewer training).
A number of changes have been made over time in the NCS and NCVS instruments and the procedures for administering them. For
example, in some cases response categories were changed, question wording was altered, and questions were added or deleted. Major
changes relating to the NCVS redesign are described in the NCVS Redesign document contained in the NCVS Resource Guide
(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS).
Due to the changes that the National Crime Victimization survey instrument has undergone over the years, a standard format for all files
is not possible. Users are strongly urged to carefully review each variable used in their analyses.
The variables that are relevant to an individual year of NCVS are contained in the current year's documentation. Variables no longer in
use are excluded from the current data files and documentation.
As new questions are added to the NCVS, ICPSR attempts to add the variables to the data files so that they parallel the flow of the
questionnaire. Inevitably, this means that new variables will be inserted between existing ones. The original NCVS variables were named
V1000's for address variables, V2000's for household variables, V3000's for person variables, and V4000's for incident variables. Suffixes
are added to new variables that are inserted between existing variables. The presence of a suffix does not mean that the variable is a
continuation of the previous one. Rather, it is most likely a completely new variable.
Actions to Minimize Losses:
Prior to an interview visit, each sample unit is sent a letter from the Bureau of the Census informing the household about the National
Crime Victimization Survey. During each enumeration period, interviews are conducted with as many eligible household members age 12
and over as possible. Questions pertaining to the entire household are asked only once of the Household Respondent (see Glossary p.
493), a single household member who could reasonably be expected to know the answers pertaining to the household. Individual Screen
Questions on the Basic Questionnaires are asked of all household members age 12 and older.
Prior to July, 1986, information about each household member 14 years and older was obtained by self-response; however, information
about members 12 and 13 years old was obtained by a proxy from either the household respondent or some other knowledgeable household
member. Since that time, 12 and 13 year olds are interviewed directly unless a knowledgeable household member insists on a proxy.
The average face-to-face household interview lasts 25 minutes. Subsequent interviews are conducted primarily by telephone. However,
in some cases subsequent interviews are conducted face-to-face for respondents without phones, who are difficult to reach by phone, or
prefer that mode over the telephone.
A sample unit for which an interview could not be obtained is classified as one of three non-interview types. Type A non-interviews consist
of households occupied by persons eligible for interviews but from whom no interviews were obtained because, for example, no one was
found at home in spite of repeated visits or the household refused to give any information. Because Type A non-interviews are considered
avoidable, every effort is made to convert them to interviews.
Type B non-interviews are for units which are unoccupied or which are occupied solely by persons who have a usual residence elsewhere
(URE).
Type C non-interviews are units ineligible for the sample because the unit is demolished, condemned, or no address was listed. Occasionally,
the field representative is unable to obtain an interview for a particular household member in an otherwise interviewed household. This
person is classified as a type Z person (see Glossary p. 493 under "Non-Interview" for more detail).
Weighting:
Because the data collected by the National Crime Victimization Survey represent the total U.S. population 12 years and older, records
can be weighted to produce population estimates from the sample cases. Weights are carried in survey records and are numbers which
one adds or accumulates to obtain universe estimates of particular events. The final weight is a multiplier that indicates how many times
a particular sample record is to be counted. Traditionally the NCVS has provided three classes of weights -- household, personal, and

-9-

- Study 34650 incident -- and the appropriate weight to select for an analysis depends on the type of crime, victim, or unit of analysis involved. These
weights are defined as:
• HOUSEHOLD WEIGHT: This weight is attached to the household record-type file and is the weight of the "Principal Person" in the
household. In husband-wife households, this is the weight for the wife, excluding the within-household non-interview adjustment (see
discussion on weighting (p. 551). For other households, the household weight is that of the individual identified as owning, buying, or
renting the dwelling (the "Reference Person"), excluding the within-household non-interview adjustment. This weight is commonly used
to calculate estimates of property crimes, such as motor vehicle theft or burglary, which are identified with the household. Household
weights, after proper adjustment, are also used to form the denominator in a calculation of crime rates.
• PERSON WEIGHT: Attached to the person record-type file, this variable provides an estimate of the population represented by each
person in the sample. Person weights are most frequently used to compute estimates of crime victimizations of persons in the total
population. Person weights, after proper adjustment, are also used to form the denominator in a calculation of crime rates.
• INCIDENT WEIGHT: This weight is attached to the incident record-type file. For personal crimes, it is derived by dividing the person
weight of a victim by the total number of persons victimized during an incident as reported by the respondent. For property crimes, the
incident weight and the household weight are the same, because the victim of a property crime is considered to be the household as
a whole. The incident weight is most frequently used to compute estimates of the number of crimes committed against a particular
class of victim.
USE OF WEIGHTED V. UNWEIGHTED DATA
BJS analyses of NCVS data typically utilize weighted data. However, analysts have used both weighted and unweighted data to examine
victimization-related research questions. Generally, using weighted data increases variance, but decreases sampling bias and bias that
is introduced through unequal probabilities of selection and observation. Weighted data are more typically used to compute representative
population estimates of victimization dynamics and to compare victimization patterns over time.
Unweighted data have been used to develop and explore predictive models of victimization. However, the analyst must assume that the
model is insensitive to small temporal variations in the composition of the NCVS sample and reporting rates and that variables in the model
are unrelated to time, if multiple years of data are utilized (see discussion on weighting and fluctuation of sample across years (p. 551).
VICTIMIZATION, HOUSEHOLD, AND PERSON COUNTS
The sample weights V2116 (household weight) and V3080 (person weight) included with the data have been constructed by census to
be representative of the national household and adult population at the time of interview. Since the sample is interviewed every six months,
the sample weights must be adjusted for use in creating annual estimates to reflect the average population size during the entire reference
year. In addition, the value of the victimization weight depends on whether the crime is against a household or a person.
Six additional weights are included with the data that have all of the relevant adjustments incorporated to create national estimates of
victimization, household counts, and person counts. The adjusted victimization, household, and person weights are included for both
collection-year and data-year formats.
Collection-year weights cover 12 months of interviews that occur during the calendar year. Collection-year weights should be used when
calculating victimization, household, and population counts to agree with those used in the Bureau of Justice Statistics' annual publication
CRIMINAL VICTIMIZATION, YYYY. The collection year - 12 months of interviews - is used to facilitate publishing crime estimates in a
timely manner. Under the collection-year format victimizations are counted (i.e., the adjusted vicimization weight is positive) if a crime is
reported during an interview occurring in the 12 months of the current year; this is regardless of when the crime incident actually occurred.
For example, if a respondent is interviewed in June, 2012 and reports a crime that occurred in December 2011, the victimization will be
counted in 2012 under the collection-year format because it was reported to the interviewer in 2012.
Data-year weights cover the entire 18 months of interviews that comprise a full NCVS year. They have been adjusted to reflect the average
population size during the reference year. In contrast to the collection-year format, under the data-year format victimizations are counted
in the year that they occurred, not when the interview occurred. The data-year format provides a better placement of the crime incident in
time. However, given the six month retrospective reference period, initial reports of crime under the data-year format could be substantially
delayed. Using the previous example where a respondent reports to an interviewer in June, 2012 that a crime occurred in December,
2011, the victimization will be counted in 2011 under the data-year format.

- Study 34650 The variables WGTVICCY and WGTVICDY are the adjusted victimization weights for collection year and data year respectively. These
weights are included on the incident record-type file, and they are used to calculate an estimate of victimizations. In a calculation of
victimization rate they are used to determine the numerator.
The variables WGTHHCY and WGTHHDY are the adjusted household weights for collection year and data year respectively. These
weights are included on the household record-type file, and they are used to calculate an estimate of households covered by the NCVS.
In a calculation of HOUSEHOLD victimization rate - which requires selecting only crimes against households - they are used to determine
the denominator.
The variables WGTPERCY and WGTPERDY are the adjusted person weights for the collection year and data year respectively. These
weights are included on the person record-type file, and they are used to calculate an estimate of persons covered by the NCVS. In a
calculation of PERSON victimization rate - which requires selecting only crimes against persons - they are used to determine the denominator.
Adjusted household and person weights, included on the household and person record-type files respectively, will be zero in certain
circumstances. Noninterviewed households and persons will have zero weight for both collection year and data year. In addition, the
adjusted household and person weights for the COLLECTION YEAR will be zero for the last six months of the 18 month period that makes
up an individual NCVS data year. This is because the collection year only includes the 12 months of interviews that occurred during the
calendar year.
The adjusted victimization weight, included on the incident record-type file, for COLLECTION YEAR (WGTVICCY) will be zero for the last
six months of the 18 month period that makes up an individual NCVS data year. Again, this is because the collection year only includes
the 12 months of interviews conducted during the calendar year. In the incident record-type file, WGTVICCY will be greater than zero for
the 12 months of the calender year and zero for the remaining six months. Under the collection-year format, victimizations are counted
based on when the interview occurred not on when the incident occurred, and they are counted for the 12 calendar months of interviews.
In the incident record-type file, the adjusted victimization weight for DATA YEAR will be zero in some circumstances. Under the data-year
format a victimization is counted based on the year the crime incident actually occurred, not when the interview was conducted. Consequently,
if an interview was conducted in February 2012 and a crime was reported as having occurred in October 2011, then the value of WGTVICDY
for 2012 will be zero. However, the weight will be greater than zero for the 2011 data year.
The adjusted household, person, and victimization weights were added to the NCVS data so that analysts would not need to compute
them directly. Those interested in the calculations necessary to compute the adjusted weights should refer to the NCVS Resource Guide
(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS). The resource guide also contains victimization, household, and person counts for collection-year
and data-year formats.
An example of calculating crime rates using weighted counts of victimizations, households, and persons is included in this documentation
(p. 545).
SERIES INCIDENTS WEIGHTING
BJS uses victimization weight in reports to account for the number of persons present during an incident and for repeat victims of series
incidents. The weight counts series incidents as the actual number of incidents reported by the victim, up to a maximum of 10 incidents.
Series victimizations are similar in type but occur with such frequency that a victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe
each event in detail. Survey procedures allow NCVS interviewers to identify and classify these similar victimizations as series victimizations
and to collect detailed information on only the most recent incident in the series. In 2010, about 3% of all victimizations were series incidents.
Weighting series incidents as the number of incidents up to a maximum of 10 incidents produces more reliable estimates of crime levels,
while the cap at 10 minimizes the effect of extreme outliers on the rates. Additional information on the series enumeration is detailed in
the report Methods for Counting High Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization Survey, NCJ 237308, BJS
website, April 2012. (http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mchfrv.pdf)
Notes
ADDRESS VERSUS HOUSEHOLD: Once an address is selected, the "household" (persons 12 and over living at that address) is interviewed.
If that household moves out and a different household moves in, the survey is conducted with this new household. That is, the survey
maintains contact with the ADDRESS originally sampled, not necessarily the INDIVIDUALS originally sampled. The variable V1006
"household number" will change to indicate that a different household is being interviewed from the previous period.

- Study 34650 ORIGINAL VARIABLES AND ALLOCATED VARIABLES: During the data collection process, responses may be keyed in incorrectly. For
most variables, any invalid entry is recoded as missing or "Residue". For some variables, however, the interviewer's original keystroke
entry is maintained in the dataset. These variables are called "Original" variables, each of which has a corresponding "Allocated" variable.
Allocated variables result from a Census Bureau recoding scheme which forces any invalid entry into a valid code. Original variables may
contain the original invalid entries.
MULTIPLE RESPONSE AND CATEGORY VARIABLES: Variable labels for multiple response questions are preceded by (LI) which
indicates the "Lead in" question, (C) which indicates any number of category questions associated with the lead-in question, and (RESIDUE)
which indicates the residue variable. Responses to the "Lead in" question may fit into any number of categories associated with it. The
"Lead in" code indicates whether at least one positive response was obtained for any of the categories. Variables for each individual
category follow the "Lead in" variable. If respondents answer "Yes" to the main question, but none of the categories is applicable, the
Lead-in code is equal to 1, the category codes are equal to 0 and the residue code is equal to 8.
NCS AND NCVS SAMPLE SPLIT: Beginning in January 1992 the national sample was split in half. For half the sample the original NCS
survey methodology was used and for the other half of the sample the NCVS redesigned survey methodology was used (see the NCVS
Redesign document in the NCVS Resource Guide (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS). When comparing 1992 data with other
years, the unweighted 1992 counts will be much lower than unweighted counts from any other year. The data collection quarters which
reflect the sample split are: 1992 - Quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4 1993 - Quarters 1 and 2.
Data Appraisal Information
Response Rate: In 2012, 127,441 households and 187,684 persons were in the sample. For 2012 the response rates for households and
persons were 87% and 87% respectively.
Estimates of Sampling Error:
The National Crime Victimization Survey is commonly used to compute estimates of victimization events in the United States population.
For example, comparing changes in annual robbery victimization rates would entail computing victimization rates for the years in question,
calculating the differences, and then testing these differences to determine whether they were statistically significant. Computing standard
errors or variances for these differences is a central task in determining whether these differences may be treated as reliable.
Standard error computation for these rates is problematic on several counts. First, estimates are generally computed not on raw data but
on weighted data, which are sums of the weights of the cases selected. To compute the rates for the robbery analysis described above,
for example, the sums of the person weights for all victimized respondents in each year would be divided by the sums of person weights
for all respondents in the same year. Computing variances on these sums as if they were independent observations would produce
artifactually small variances and thus would compromise the statistical tests involved.
Second, the NCVS relies on a stratified, multi-stage cluster sample design. Clustering of households in the sample results in variances
that are smaller than would be achieved with a simple random sample design. Failure to take account of this "design effect" when using
standard statistical tests will make accurate testing difficult, because standard tests assume independence among observations and a
simple, random sample design.
There are two strategies available to calculate variances for NCVS data which avoid these problems -- computing generalized variances
and using direct variance calculation methods designed for complex survey designs.
GENERALIZED VARIANCES
Before the 1992 NCVS redesign implementation, a set of standard errors was estimated using the Taylor Expansion Method and was
generalized to be applicable to all survey estimates. Generalized curves were produced from subsets of computed standard errors, and
formulae developed for these curves, which would allow analysts to calculate the standard error of any survey estimate. These formulae
and the constant applicable for each year and general domain of crime have been provided for each year of published NCS data.
In the 1992-1997 NCVS data, a Jackknife Repeated Replication procedure was used to estimate standard errors, and a new set of formulae
and constants was provided to calculate standard errors. Study of NCVS data had determined that the design effect was not constant
across all survey estimates and that the new procedures provided a more accurate method for computing standard errors. Beginning in
1998, a Balanced Repeated Replication procedure was used to estimate standard errors.

- 12 -

- Study 34650 Four formulae are available to calculate the appropriate standard error, depending on the type of estimate involved. Each formula requires
the analyst to use a set of constants that varies between year and domain of crime. Constants for each NCVS year and examples of how
to use them are contained on the NCVS Resource Guide (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS).
DIRECT VARIANCE CALCULATION
Although generalized variance functions are useful for calculating population estimates of NCVS data, they are not well adapted to more
complex statistical modeling and testing. A number of methods for calculating variances for complex sample designs directly from the
data have been developed over the last decade, and these are better suited for statistical modeling.
However, data files must provide either clustering information or "pseudo-strata" that will allow the dataset to be subsetted for multiple
"replicate" calculations. NCVS public use files have been updated to provide variables containing pseudo-strata and half sample coding
- V2117 and V2118. With this enhancement, software can now be used with the public use data files to calculate direct variances.

Missing Data:
There are four missing data codes used in this collection:
1) RESIDUE - This type of missing data is represented by 8's or a combination of 9's and 8's. Residue can indicate a keying error which
resulted in an out-of-range code, an incorrect or unusable answer by the respondent, or the absence of an entry for a question that should
have been asked.
There are two types of residue on multiple response variables on NCVS data files. The first type of residue occurs when the entire item
was not ascertained. In this instance, there will be a code 8 on the lead-in variable, an 8 in each of the multiple response category variables,
and an 8 on the residue variable for that multiple response question.
The second type of residue occurs when there is a "yes" for the lead-in question but the specific categories of the multiple response items
are not ascertained. In this situation there will be a code 1 on the lead-in variable and an 8 on the residue variable. The multiple response
category variables will all have 0 entered.
2) OUT OF UNIVERSE - This type of missing data is represented by 9's. This code indicates that the case is outside of the applicable
range or universe of questions to be answered. For instance for V4127, "Received Medical Care for Injury", only victims who report being
injured are asked whether they received medical care. All other victims are skipped past this question and are coded "9" on this variable.
In BJS publications, Residue categories, such as "Don't know" are often included in tabulations and are thus not classed as missing data.
Data users may choose to define these Residue codes as missing data if it is useful for their analytic purposes.
See the Notes for a tabular summary of these two missing data codes and types.
3) ITEM INVALID UNTIL YYYY Q# - This type of missing data is represented by -1. Variables with this code were created during the data
year, and the code of -1 means that the missing data is due to the item not being in use the full data year. The code distinguishes it from
normal out of universe missing data.
4) ITEM INVALID AFTER YYYY Q# - This type of missing data is represented by -2. Variables with this code were dropped from use
during the data year. The code distinguishes it from normal out of universe missing data.

Notes
INCIDENTS VS. VICTIMIZATIONS: For personal crimes, the NCVS makes a basic distinction between "incidents" and "victimizations."
The number of victimizations reflects how many criminal acts were experienced by NCVS survey respondents; the number of incidents
reflects the number of criminal acts committed against NCVS respondents and others present during such incidents, as reported by survey
respondents. If there was more than one victim, the incident weight is adjusted to compensate for the possibility that the incident could
be reported several times by multiple victims and thus be over-counted. For example, if a survey respondent and two other people
(non-respondents) were robbed during the same incident, the NCVS counts this as one-third of a personal incident and as one victimization.
If all victims were respondents, this criminal act would be counted as one incident and three victimizations. Therefore, estimates of the
number of personal incidents are usually lower than estimates of personal victimizations.
Estimates of incidents and victimizations can be made by using weights. For personal crimes the variable "INCIDENT WEIGHT" [V4527]
was computed by dividing the person's weight by the total number of persons victimized during the incident and is used to estimate incident
totals. To calculate a victimization count, users should use the variable "ADJUSTED VICTIMIZATION WEIGHT" (WGTVICCY or WGTVICDY
for collection year or data year respectively).
HOUSEHOLD CRIMES: By definition household crimes are committed against the household as a whole. Therefore, a household crime
can only have one "victim" -- the household. Accordingly, the victimization weight equals the incident weight for household crimes.
CHANGES IN THE DEFINITION OF THEFT: Due to a change in the NCVS definition of Theft, most property crimes are now classified
as Household Theft (the exceptions are purse-snatching and pocket-picking). Therefore, the Household Weight should be used for all
property theft without contact and the Person Weight should be used for all purse-snatching and pocket-picking crimes. The decision of
whether to use the person weight or household weight has been incorporated into the adjusted victimization weights for collection year
and data year (WGTVICCY and WGTVICDY). See Glossary (p. 493) for details on the Theft redefinition.
TYPE OF CRIME CODE (TOC): During 1992 Quarters 1 and 2 the type of crime (TOC) "Unwanted Sexual Contact Without Force" (code
"16" V4528 and V4529) did not exist. For this TOC and related crimes, therefore, comparisons of the 1992 data with future years should
be avoided.

File Name: 2012 Collection Year Incident-Level Extract File
Contents of Files:
The incident-level extract file is not the same as the incident record-type file. The incident-level extract file is a file created by prepending
household and person variables to incident records using the YEARQ (YEAR AND QUARTER OF INTERVIEW), IDHH (NCVS ID FOR
HOUSEHOLDS), and IDPER (NCVS ID FOR PERSONS) variables as match keys. For data-year formats, this file has been "bounded"
to contain incidents occurring within the specific calendar year, regardless of when the interview was conducted. Under the collection-year
format, the incident-level extract file is not "bounded" based on when the incidents occurred; rather, it contains incidents reported in 2012,
regardless of when they occurred.
Example code for creating a collection year incident-level extract file is included in this document (p. 540).

Variable Type: character
Text:
Source code: ICPSR_IDHH
Text: ICPSR added this variable to facilitate matching of data files. The ID for households is unique within a six month interview period.
Given the rotating panel design of NCVS, a value of IDHH may appear in a year of data one, two, or three times. The variables YEARQ
and IDHH uniquely identify a household at a given interview within the NCVS.

Variable Type: character
Text:
Source code: Scrambled Control Number
Notes:
Beginning with the quarter 1, 2006 (YEARQ = 2006.1) NCVS data files, Census used the 2000 sample design control number scrambling
routine to scramble control numbers for 1990 and 2000 sample design cases. Therefore, data users will not be able to match 1990 sample
design cases on NCVS data files released for quarter 1, 2006 and beyond (YEARQ >= 2006.1) to 1990 sample design cases on NCVS
data files prior to quarter 1, 2006 (YEARQ <= 2006.1).
Scrambled control was expanded to 20 characters in 2005 Q1. Consequently it was defined as a string variable.
Beginning in July 1986 the previously used PSU, segment number, check digit and serial number are scrambled together by the Census
Bureau as one variable to preserve confidentiality.
For 1980 sample-first 10 digits -- last four digits are blank (through quarter 4, 1995). For 1990 sample-all 14 digits are used (beginning
quarter 3, 1995). Scrambled control number (part) - See V1007 for last two digits of scrambled control number.

Source code: Scrambled Control Number
Notes:
Beginning with the quarter 1, 2006 (YEARQ = 2006.1) NCVS data files, Census used the 2000 sample design control number scrambling
routine to scramble control numbers for 1990 and 2000 sample design cases. Therefore, data users will not be able to match 1990 sample
design cases on NCVS data files released for quarter 1, 2006 and beyond (YEARQ >= 2006.1) to 1990 sample design cases on NCVS
data files prior to quarter 1, 2006 (YEARQ <= 2006.1).
Scrambled control was expanded to 20 characters in 2005 Q1. Consequently it was defined as a string variable.
Beginning in July 1986 the previously used PSU, segment number, check digit and serial number are scrambled together by the Census
Bureau as one variable to preserve confidentiality.
For 1980 sample-first 10 digits -- last four digits are blank (through quarter 4, 1995). For 1990 sample-all 14 digits are used (beginning
quarter 3, 1995). Scrambled control number (part) - See V3007 for last two digits of scrambled control number.

Source code: Scrambled Control Number
Notes:
Beginning with the quarter 1, 2006 (YEARQ = 2006.1) NCVS data files, Census used the 2000 sample design control number scrambling
routine to scramble control numbers for 1990 and 2000 sample design cases. Therefore, data users will not be able to match 1990 sample
design cases on NCVS data files released for quarter 1, 2006 and beyond (YEARQ >= 2006.1) to 1990 sample design cases on NCVS
data files prior to quarter 1, 2006 (YEARQ <= 2006.1).
Scrambled control was expanded to 20 characters in 2005 Q1. Consequently it was defined as a string variable.

- 190 -

- Study 34650 Beginning in July 1986 the previously used PSU, segment number, check digit and serial number are scrambled together by the Census
Bureau as one variable to preserve confidentiality.
For 1980 sample-first 10 digits -- last four digits are blank (through quarter 4, 1995). For 1990 sample-all 14 digits are used (beginning
quarter 3, 1995). Scrambled control number (part) - See V4007 for last two digits of scrambled control number.

- Study 34650 For quarters 1 and 2, 2006, adjustments were made to the final weights that impacted the weighted crime estimates for the NCVS. This
adjustment was a one-time event implemented to counteract the effects of including the bounding interview on the NCVS PUF. Traditionally,
the bounding interview is excluded from the PUF.
Past research has shown that unbounded interviews produce higher victimization rates than bounded interviews. Therefore a decision
was made to adjust downward the estimated number of crimes reported in the new areas to reduce the bias caused by using unbounded
interviews. There is also evidence that victimization rates may vary by the number of times the household has been interviewed. To reflect
this, the adjustment was performed by time in sample (TIS).
The adjustments made to the final weights were based on collection-year 2003 data due to the unavailability of the collection-year 2005
data and anomalies encountered in the 2004 data. One set of adjustment factors was calculated for personal crimes by TIS and another
for property crimes by TIS.
These adjustment factors were applied to the final weight of persons and households. The victimization weight contains these adjusted
weights. For any other time period, the victimization weight will be the same as the person weight or household weight for personal and
property crimes, respectively.
Notes: This variable started in quarter 1, 2005.

Glossary
Text:

This glossary describes definitions and procedures currently employed
in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). These definitions
and procedures reflect a major redesign of the survey implemented in
two stages: "Near-Term" changes and "Long-Term" changes. Generally,
the "Near-Term" changes refer to improvements made to the Crime
Incident Report and implemented in 1986. The "Long-Term" changes refer
to improvements made to the Screening Section that were fully
implemented in 1993 and where "Long-Term" changes created a break in
series by affecting the likelihood that a victimization would be
reported. Data collected before this break are referred to as NCS, and
data gathered afterwards as NCVS. Specific changes are noted (by "NCS
NOTE" and "NCVS NOTE") where relevant and indicate when the changes
were implemented in the field. See NCVS Redesign document in the NCVS
Resource Guide (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS) for a description of
why and how these changes were made.

ADDRESS SEGMENT
See: Segment
AGE
Age is determined by asking the respondent for month, day, and year of
birth. From this birth date, the field representative determines the
respondent's age as of the last day of the month previous to the
interview month. The respondent is asked to verify the calculated
age. This age is used to determine a respondent's eligibility for the
survey according to the following rules:
1) under 12: not interviewed (though the number of such children
living in the household is asked of the household respondent)
2) 12 and older: universe for interviews
3) 16 and older: additional questions on employment status are
asked
NCS NOTE: Prior to July, 1986, 12- and 13-year-olds were
interviewed by proxy respondent (a respondent who answers
questions for another person). As of July 1986,
respondents age 12 and older are interviewed directly,
unless they are ill or otherwise unavailable, or a
knowledgeable adult objects to the interviewing of 12and 13-year-olds in the household.

ASSAULT

- 493 -

- Study 34650 The NCVS defines assault as an unlawful physical attack, whether
aggravated or simple, upon a person. It includes attempted assaults
with or without a weapon, but excludes rape, attempted rape, and
sexual assaults (these are categorized separately). Assaults also
exclude attacks involving theft or attempted theft (these are
classified as robbery). Severity of assaults are classified into two
major sub-categories:
1) Simple Assault: an attack without a weapon resulting either in
minor injury (e.g., bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches,
swelling) or an undetermined injury requiring less than two days
of hospitalization. It also includes attempted assault without a
weapon and verbal threats of assault.
2) Aggravated Assault: an attack or attempted attack with a weapon,
regardless of whether or not an injury occurred, and attack
without a weapon when serious injury results. Serious injury
includes broken bones, loss of teeth, internal injuries, loss of
consciousness, and any injury requiring two or more days of
hospitalization.

ARMED FORCES
See: Military Status
ATTACK
Some form of actual physical contact between the victim and the
offender. If something was thrown at the victim but did not hit
him/her or if s/he was shot at but not struck by the bullet, s/he is
not considered to have been attacked, but threatened.

ATTEMPT
Definitions of attempted crimes vary by type of crime. See entries for
individual crimes for definition.
AUTO THEFT
See: Motor Vehicle Theft
BASIC SCREEN QUESTIONNAIRE
A set of questions used to elicit reports of crimes against the
household and its members (for a list of the types of crimes measured
by the NCVS, see CRIMES). The screening is also used to obtain
characteristics of the household and individual household members 12
years of age and older. The screen questionnaire is composed of
several types of items:
1) Cover page for household identification items (e.g.: address,

- 494 -

- Study 34650 segment number) and general information (e.g.: number of members
in the household, type of living quarters)
2) Personal characteristics items for obtaining general information
on persons (e.g.: age, marital status, sex, race)
3) Household screen questions, asked only of the Household
Respondent, to elicit information on whether any property crimes
were committed during the reference period
4) Individual screen questions, asked of all household members 12
and older including the Household Respondent, to elicit
information on whether any crimes against individual household
members were committed during the reference period
5) Questions dealing with household and individual vulnerability
to crime.
The household and individual screen questions are designed to describe
all crimes within the scope of the NCVS using everyday language (not
legal or technical definitions). Multiple examples of features likely
to accompany a criminal incident are provided as cues to jar
respondents' memories and to provide a more complete picture of the
kinds of incidents included in the survey. If a respondent answers yes
to any of the screen questions or cues, a complete Incident Report is
filled out and the crime is classified according to the NCVS Crime
Classification scheme.

Questionnaire Forms, Interviewing Sequence, NCVS Crime
Classification
NCVS NOTE: Beginning in January 1993, significant changes to the
household and individual screen sections were
implemented. See the NCVS Redesign document in the NCVS
Resource Guide (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS)
for a discussion of these changes.
BOUNDING PROCEDURE
A technique used in the NCVS to establish a reference point during the
first interview to avoid recording duplicate reports of incidents in
subsequent interviews. The first interview conducted at the household
is considered a bounding interview. Data collected from this interview
do not become part of the final dataset but are compared with
incidents reported in the second interview. If the interviewer
determines that a newly-reported incident is the same incident that
has already been reported in the bounding interview, the incident is
eliminated. Incidents reported in this second interview then become
the new reference point for comparison with incidents reported in the
third interview, and so on.
NCVS NOTE: Reporting procedures have been slightly modified.
Previously, interviewers collected information on
incidents only within the 6-month reference period which
ends on the last day of the month preceding the
interview if respondents reported very recent incidents

- 495 -

- Study 34650 -- those that occurred after the reference period ended
but before the interview actually took place -- details
on the incident were not recorded at that time but
during the subsequent interview. Deferring the Incident
Report may have resulted in less accurate recall during
the subsequent interview. To address this concern, NCVS
procedures were modified to allow an Incident Report to
be filled out even if the crime occurred after the
6-month reference period. Data on these incidents are
held and tabulated along with data from the subsequent
interview.
NOTE: In the NCS National Samples of 1972 and the first half of
1973, the first-time interviews were unbounded. Bounded
interviews started in January 1973 and July 1973 for the
first rotation groups; thus, by July 1973, bounded interviews
were being conducted in all returning rotation groups.
Because of the large number of unbounded interviews, the 1972
National Sample files have not been released. See also:
Sample Rotation, Reference Period
BURGLARY
One of the six major types of crimes covered by the NCVS, burglary is
unlawful or forcible entry or attempted entry of a residence. This
crime usually, but not always, involves theft. The illegal entry may
be by force, such as breaking a window or slashing a screen, or may be
without force by entering through an unlocked door or an open
window. As long as the person entering has no legal right to be
present in the structure, a burglary has occurred. Furthermore, the
structure need not be the house itself for a burglary to take place;
illegal entry of a garage, shed, or any other structure on the
premises also constitutes household burglary. If breaking and entering
occurs in a hotel or vacation residence, it is still classified as a
burglary for the household whose member or members were staying there
at the time the entry occurred.

Attempted Forcible Entry
CENTRAL CITY
The incorporated city (or cities) which is central to an urbanized
area and/or a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). It is bounded by
city limits. A central city or the combined central cities must have a
population of 50,000 or more.

Description Code
CHECK DIGIT
In the NCVS National Sample, the check digit is computed on the nine
digits of the sample number PSU, and segment number. The check digit
is part of the control number which uniquely identifies a sample unit.
See also: Control Number Since July 1986, the five elements of the

- 496 -

- Study 34650 control number have been scrambled to preserve
confidentiality.
CHILDREN UNDER 12, CRIMES AGAINST
Because of the complexity of the NCVS questionnaire and the
standardized interviewing procedures, crimes against children under 12
are not measured by the NCVS. In keeping with NCVS crime definitions,
however, there is one exception: if items belonging to a child were
stolen and there was no contact between the offender and a household
member, the incident is treated as a property crime, provided the
incident occurred at or near the parent's place of residence.
CLASS OF WORKER
The employment status of a respondent. Categories include:
1) Private Employee: persons who work for a private employer for
wages, salary, commission, tips, piece-rates, or pay in kind.
This applies regardless of the occupation at which the employee
worked, whether general manager, file clerk, or porter. Also
includes persons working for pay for settlement houses,
churches, unions, and other private non-profit organizations.
2) Government Employee: persons who work for any branch of federal,
state or local governments. This includes persons who were
elected to paid federal offices and members of the Armed
Forces. It also includes employees of international
organizations and employees of foreign governments.
3) Self-Employed: persons who work for profit or fees in own
business, farm, shop, office, etc. This does not apply to
managers, superintendents, or other executives hired to manage a
business.
4) Working Without Pay: persons working without pay on a farm or
business operated by a related member of the household. Room and
board and a cash allowance are not counted as pay for these
family workers; however, if the worker receives money which is
definitely considered to be wages for work performed, he or she
should be considered a private employee.

CLOSEOUT
This refers to the time period in which either interviewers or the
regional offices try to obtain interviews from non-interviewed persons
prior to transmitting the questionnaire data for keying.
CLUSTER
A group of four housing units. Clustering is done so that selected
sample units are in relatively close geographic proximity in order for
interviews to be carried out in an efficient manner. Because of this
clustering, the variance estimates are slightly larger than they would
be if the sample design used a simple random sample selection scheme

See: Segment
COLLECTION QUARTER
A calendar quarter of the year (three months) during which interviews
are conducted in the NCVS. For example, the first collection quarter
consists of interviews conducted in January, February, and March. The
six-month reference period for the January interviews is July 1
through December 31. The reference period for February interviews is
August 1 through January 31, and so on. Because the reference period
is six months long and because interviews are bounded (see "Bounding"
above), 18 months of data collection (or 6 Collection Quarters) are
necessary to yield one full year's worth of (bounded) data under the
DATA-YEAR format.
See also: Reference Period, Bounding Procedure (NCVS Note)
COMPLETE SAMPLE FILES NCVS
Data files containing data for both interviewed and non-interviewed
households, victims and non-victims. The files are hierarchical in
structure, consisting of four record types:
1)
2)
3)
4)

Address ID records
Household records
Person records
Incident records (including series incidents)

The National Complete Sample files are arranged by the quarter in
which the interviews were conducted (collection quarters).
COMPUTER-ASSISTED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWING (CATI)
Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) involves bringing
interviewers into a centralized telephone facility to conduct the
survey over the phone by reading questions off of a computer screen
and entering responses directly into the computer. CATI stores
information provided by the respondent as the survey progresses,
automatically presenting the interviewer with the appropriate next
question in the survey sequence. CATI software is designed with
automated internal consistency checks to alert the interviewer of
responses that may need to be clarified with the respondent. The CATI
technique is contrasted with the field technique, in which
interviewers around the country conduct telephone or face-to-face
interviews and record responses in pencil on a printed
questionnaire. CATI is not utilized for the following circumstances:
1) All NCVS interviews for the first (of seven) scheduled
interviews for households in sample will be conducted in person
so as establish and maintain rapport with respondents. No
household will receive its initial NCVS contact from a CATI
facility.
2) Respondents without access to a telephone or who refuse during
the interview to receive subsequent interviews by telephone will

- 498 -

- Study 34650 continue to be interviewed in person.
3) To minimize disruption of field interviewer staffing and
workloads and to avoid elimination of some single-interviewer
Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), CATI is fully implemented only in
PSUs that are covered by more than one field representative. On
single field representative PSUs, only half are eligible for
CATI, and in these PSUs only half the segments are assigned to
CATI interviewing.
NCS/NCVS NOTE: Phase-in of CATI began in 1987. From 1987 to 1992, 5
to 10 percent of the NCS sample used CATI. From 1992
on, CATI was used for 30 percent of the NCVS sample.
Since 2007, CATI has been discontinued as a mode.
CONFIDENTIALITY
The law (U.S. Code 42, Section 3771, 3789g, and 3735) provides that
all information given to the U.S. Bureau of the Census for this survey
must be held in confidence and may be used only for statistical
purposes. The Bureau may not release any statistics which might
disclose the identity of any individual or household. This protection
explains why public data often do not provide the level of detail many
researchers might wish. Current restrictions prohibit identification
of less than 0.5% of the sample, when releasing individual or
microdata.
CONTROL CARD
The control card (sometimes referred to as the "cover sheet") is one
of four basic forms used to collect the NCVS data. It is the first
form the interviewer completes during the initial interview and is
updated on each subsequent interview as long as the household is in
the sample. It contains the address of each sample unit and the basic
household data, such as the names of all persons living there and
their age, race, sex, marital status, education, etc. In addition,
such items as family income, tenure of the unit, and pertinent
information about non-interviewed units are included on the Control
Card. The Control Card also serves as a record of visits, telephone
calls, reasons for interview and non-interview, etc.
See also: Interviewing Sequence, Questionnaire Forms
CONTROL NUMBER
A control number is assigned to each sample unit. In the National
Sample, the control number is composed of five elements: the sample,
PSU, Segment number, Check Digit, and Serial Number. Since July 1986,
these five elements have been scrambled together to preserve
confidentiality.

Identification Code, Sample Designation
CRIME INCIDENT REPORT
A set of questions used to gather details (e.g.: location of incident,

- 499 -

- Study 34650 relationship of victim to offender, extent of injuries and/or economic
loss) on crimes reported in the Basic Screen Questionnaire. This
information is used to categorize the incident (see NCVS Crime
Classification). Details from the Incident Report also serve as a
database for analysis of crime (e.g.: susceptibility to crime). One
Crime Incident Report is completed for each incident reported in
answer to the screen questions (with the exception of "Series Crimes;"
see the section - Type of Research Instrument for details on series
crimes incident reports). The following conditions must be met before
a series incident is reported: (1) incidents must be of the same type
or very similar in detail; (2) there must be at least six incidents
in the series (this threshold was changed from three incidents to
six incidents in January 1993); and (3) the respondent must not be
able to recall dates and other details of the individual incidents
well enough to have reported them separately. Interviewers are
instructed to try through probing to get individual reports
whenever possible and only accept series reports as a last resort.
See also: Questionnaire Forms, Series Incident Report, Interviewing
Sequence
NCS NOTE: The Crime Incident Report was significantly modified in
1986 to provide more information on characteristics of
the crime incident. See the NCVS Redesign document in the
NCVS Resource Guide (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS).
CRIMES
The National Crime Victimization Survey focuses on measuring the
extent of victimization by the major crimes commonly referred to as
rape, robbery, assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft. The
survey does not provide measures for other offenses such as murder,
kidnapping, shoplifting, fraud, gambling, etc.
NCVS NOTE: Prior to January, 1993, the NCVS defined 32 distinct
types of crime. The NCVS modifications redefined some
crimes (Theft and Series Crimes) and added crimes not
previously measured (Sexual Assault other than Completed
and Attempted Rape, and Vandalism). Since 2009, the NCVS
no longer collects information about vandalism. See the
NCVS Redesign document in the NCVS Resource Guide
(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS).

DATA COLLECTION OR ENUMERATION PERIOD
The length of time allotted to interviewers for completing their
assigned workload for a survey or census; commonly referred to as the
interview period. For the NCVS, households are enumerated during the
first two weeks of every month.
See also: Household Status, Enumeration
ED
See: Enumeration District (ED)
EDUCATION
Current education level of household members listed on the control

- 501 -

- Study 34650 card. Respondents are asked the highest grade or year of regular
school attended, and whether that year was completed. Regular schools
include all graded public, private, parochial schools, colleges,
universities, and professional schools which advance a person toward
an elementary or high school diploma, or a college degree. Regular
schools do not include vocational, trade, business, correspondence, or
other specialized schools, unless credits obtained are accepted in the
regular school system. For persons still attending regular school,
highest grade attended is the one in which they are currently
enrolled. Education questions, which are on the control card, are
asked routinely at the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th visits only.
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT
The highest year completed. This is a recoded variable for use in BJS
published reports. It is classified as follows: Never attended or
kindergarten, Elementary, High School, College, and N.A. Post-graduate
work is coded as "College."
ENUMERATION
The process of obtaining information about selected units of study in
a survey or census.
ENUMERATION DISTRICT (ED)
A small geographic area with well-defined boundaries set up for the
1990 Census and containing about 250 households. A single PSU contains
numerous EDs. In the NCVS National Sample, each selected ED is
subdivided into clusters of four households, and a sample of these
clusters is systematically selected. All four households in the
cluster are selected to be in the sample.
See also: Primary Sampling Unit (PSU), Cluster
ENUMERATION PERIOD
See: Data Collection Period
ESTIMATE
A numeric value obtained from a sample used to describe the
measurement which would be obtained if a complete census were carried
out. An estimate of a total for a population is obtained by
multiplying the value for a sampled record by a systematically
designed weight which has the effect of inflating the sample count to
represent the total population. Multiple factors are used to compute
this weight (see the section on - Weights). Basically, the sample
count is inflated by the reciprocal of its probability of selection.
Each estimate has its own unique variance and standard error which
express the precision of the estimate.
See also: Variance, Weight, Standard Error
ETHNICITY
A household respondent's self-reported statement of the national,

- 502 -

- Study 34650 cultural, or linguistic group with which each member of the household
identifies. Currently, the NCVS gathers data on Hispanic ethnicity
only.

ETHNICITY OF OFFENDER
The ethnicity of offender as perceived and reported by the respondent.
Categories are whether offender was Hispanic or Latino. When recording
the ethnicity of multiple offenders, categories are: mostly Hispanic or
Latino, mostly non-Hispanic, equal number of Hispanic and non-Hispanic,
and don't know.
See also: Race of offender
EXTRA UNITS
Household units or OTHER units which are discovered at time of
interview or during updating and are not already entered on the
listing sheet for the segment.
1) Area Segments:
a.

In Area segments, EXTRA units must be in the same structure
or on the same property as the sample unit being
interviewed.

b.

In Special Places within Area segments, an EXTRA unit must
be within the specific address of the original unit.

2) In Address and Special Place segments, EXTRA units must be
within the specific address of the sample unit being
interviewed, but need not be within the same structure or on the
same property.
3) In Permit segments, EXTRA units must be within the specific
address of the sample unit being interviewed and must be within
the same structure. When housing units or OTHER units which
qualify as EXTRA units are discovered, they are interviewed and
allocated to the sample without bias.
See also: Segment, Housing Unit, Other Unit, Special Places,
Listing, Household Status, Updating
FINAL WEIGHT
A final adjustment factor used to inflate each sample observation so
that it properly represents the population. The final weight is a
factor of six component weights and ratio adjustments (see section Weights). For personal crimes, the final weight equals the person
weight times five adjustment factors; for property crimes, the final
weight equals the household weight times these adjustment factors.
See also: Household Weight, Person Weight
FORCIBLE ENTRY

- 503 -

- Study 34650 A form of burglary in which force is used to gain entrance; e.g., by
breaking a window or slashing a screen. Forcible entry may or may not
be accompanied by theft or property damage. Evidence of force must be
physical and visible, i.e., able to be seen after the occurrence of
the incident. An open or unlocked door is not physical, visible
evidence.
See also: Burglary, Unlawful Entry Without Force, Attempted Forcible

GROUP QUARTERS
Census term used to describe living quarters occupied by five or more
persons unrelated to the head of household. Quarters with no
designated head but with six or more unrelated persons are also group
quarters. Some quarters occupied by fewer than six persons may also be
group quarters by definition; e.g., living quarters in dormitories
occupied by students. Group quarters were selected from Census
listings.

HATE CRIME
From 2003-2009, hate crime variables V4526AA (source code 910),
V4526HA1 (Source Code 915), V4526HA2 (SC916), V4526HA3 (SC917),
V4526HA4 (SC918), V4526HA5 (SC919), V4526HA6 (SC920), V4526HA7 (SC
921), V4526HA8 (SC922), and V4526HA9 (SC908), were suppressed from the
public use files. During this time, the hate crime recode (V4526I)
was created to designate an incident as a hate crime, a possible hate
crime, or not a hate crime. Beginning in 2010, all hate crime
variables were included in the public use files and the hate crime
recode (V4526I) was removed. The statements below can be used to
create a recode comparable to the hate crime recode. Please note that
in keeping with the definition of hate crime used by the Hate Crime
Statistics Act (HCSA) of 1994 (28 U.S.C '534'), crimes that were
committed because of gender bias were not included in the hate crime
recode. In 2009, the HCSA was expanded to include crimes committed
because of bias against the victim's gender or gender identity.
The hate crime recode is set to 1 (incident is a hate crime) when
there is an entry of 1 in any of the following variables: V4526A,

HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD
Prior to 1979, one person in each household was designated as "head,"
usually the person reported by the members of the household to be the
head. Beginning in 1979 a non-head of household approach was
instituted and interviewers were instead instructed to designate a
"reference person" -- the household member who owns, is buying, or is
renting the housing unit. The reference person may be any one
household member 18 years of age or older -- usually the first person
listed in the household membership. If all household members are under
18, the interviewer will choose the person identified as owning or
renting the living quarters.

See: Household Victimization; This classification of crime has been
revised in the NCVS and is now labeled "property crimes."
HOUSEHOLD INCIDENT
See: Household Victimization; This classification has been revised

HOUSEHOLD INCOME
The sum of income received by all household members (14 years of age
or older) living in a sample housing unit. The income may include
wages, salaries, net income from business, farm or rent, pension,
dividends, interest, social security payments, alimony, public
assistance, child support, and any other money received by household
members age 14 or older, and other money income (not identified as
income are such things as room and board, insurance payments, lump sum
inheritances, occasional gifts, money from selling property,
withdrawals from savings accounts, or tax refunds) for the 12-month
period immediately preceding the month of interview. It is not the
calendar year unless the month of the interview was January. Family
income questions are asked routinely during the first, third, fifth,
and seventh interviews only.

- 506 -

- Study 34650 HOUSEHOLD MEMBER
Persons in a sample unit are members of the household if:
1) their usual place of residence at the time of the
interview is the sample unit, and
2) they have no usual place of residence elsewhere. Usual place of
residence must be specific living quarters held by the person,
to which s/he is free to return at any time, and at which s/he
usually lives and sleeps. Household members not only include
members of the family, but may also include: lodgers, servants,
other employees who live in the unit and consider it their usual
place of residence. Usual residents also include persons who
live in the sample unit but are temporarily absent. Armed Forces
members are considered household members if they are stationed
nearby and usually sleep in the sample unit. Students attending
school away from home are not considered household members at
their parents' home.
See also: Household, Sample Unit
HOUSEHOLD NUMBER
Identifies the sequence of households that occupy a particular
address. The household interviewed at the initial visit receives a
household number of "l". If members of that household change, but at
least one household member remains at the address during subsequent
interviews, the household number remains a "1". If a new family moves
into a sample unit being interviewed for a second time, the household
number will be "2" indicating that this is a different household from
that previously interviewed.
See also: Household Status
HOUSEHOLD RESPONDENT
A household member chosen by the interviewer who appears to be the
most knowledgeable about the household composition and is able to
answer the household screen questions dealing with crimes against the
household. This person is generally 18 years of age or older; however,
if no one in the household is at least 18 years of age, the
interviewer will choose someone who appears to be knowledgeable about
the entire household. The household respondent is not necessarily the
reference person or the principal person.
See also: Reference Person, Principal Person
HOUSEHOLD SCREEN QUESTIONS
These questions ask about any crimes against the household, such as
actual or attempted break-ins, theft of household goods, and motor
vehicle thefts. These screen questions are asked of the Household
Respondent only and are used to determine whether a Crime Incident
Report should be completed.
See also: Basic Screen Questionnaire, Individual Screen

- Study 34650 Questions, Crime Incident Report
HOUSEHOLD STATUS
Consists of the following categories:
1) Same household as last enumeration, if the same household
was interviewed during the previous interview period.
2) Replacement household since last enumeration if the former
occupants have moved and the unit is now occupied by a new
household.
3) Previous non-interview or not in sample before -- for an
interviewed unit that was previously non-interviewed for any
reason, for a unit in its first period of enumeration, or for an
EXTRA unit being interviewed for the first time.
See also: Extra Units, Enumeration
HOUSEHOLD THEFT
See: Theft
HOUSEHOLD VICTIMIZATION
A specific criminal act as it affects the household. This NCS class of
crime has been replaced by a revised classification -- property
victimization in the NCVS. The NCS defined household crimes as
burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft. Each criminal act against a
household is considered to involve a single victim: the affected
household (therefore, the terms household victimization and household
incident are synonymous). If any household member is attacked or
threatened during the crime, it is considered a personal crime and
reports are taken from each person who was personally
victimized. Typically, household victimizations were reported by the
Household Respondent. However, any interviewed member could report
household crimes in response to individual screen questions.
See also: Personal Victimization, Household Screen Questions,
Property Victimization NCVS
NCVS NOTE: Beginning in January 1993, information on vandalism
against a household was also collected. Beginning in
2009 the NCVS no longer collected information on
vandalism against the household.
HOUSEHOLD WEIGHT
In the NCVS the household weight equals the person weight of the
"Principal Person." The weight for the principal person in
husband-wife households equals the weight for the wife, excluding the
within-household non-interview adjustment. For non-husband-wife
households, the principal person weight equals the weight for the
reference person, excluding the within-household non-interview
adjustment.

HOUSING UNIT
A group of rooms or a single room, occupied as separate living
quarters. Separate living quarters exist when the occupants do not
live and eat with any other persons in the structure, AND when there
is either direct access from the outside or through a common hall, OR
complete kitchen facilities for this unit only. Vacant rooms or groups
of rooms, which are intended for occupancy as separate living
quarters, are also considered housing units. A unit has complete
kitchen facilities when it has an installed sink with piped water AND
a range or cooking stove AND a mechanical refrigerator. All units in
the National Sample are defined as either being a housing unit or an
OTHER unit.
See also: Group Quarters, Living Quarters, Extra Unit, Household,
Occupied Housing Unit, Vacant Housing Unit, Other Unit
IDENTIFICATION CODE
A sample designation and control number assigned to each sample unit.
See also: Sample Designation, Control Number
INCIDENT
A specific criminal act involving one or more victims and
offenders. In the NCVS, victims may be persons 12 years of age or
older or households. An incident is technically distinct from a
victimization; in criminal acts against persons, the number of
victimizations is determined by the number of victims. Hence, one
incident may comprise several victimizations.
See also: Crimes, Victimization, Household Victimization, Personal
Victimization, Personal Incident
INCIDENT REPORT
See: Crime Incident Report
INCIDENT WEIGHT
For personal crimes the incident weight is computed by dividing the
person's weight by the total number of persons victimized during an
incident as reported by the respondent. For example, if a respondent
reports having been robbed at the same time as two friends, three
people are considered to have been victimized by the robbery
incident. The incident weight in this case would be computed by
dividing the person weight by three. For household crimes, the
incident weight and the household weight are the same, since there can
be only one household that sustains a crime incident.

- Study 34650 See: Family Income
INDIVIDUAL SCREEN QUESTIONS
A set of questions asked of each household member 12 years of age and
older. These questions are designed to elicit reports of both violent
crimes (rape, sexual assault, robbery, simple and aggravated assault)
and purse-snatching or pocket-picking committed against individual
household members. A Crime Incident Report is completed for each crime
recorded in the Individual Screen Questions.
See also: Basic Screen Questionnaire, Household Screen Questions,
Crime Incident Report
INDUSTRY CODE
NCS NOTE: Prior to March 1986, a three-digit numeric code was
assigned to persons using the 1970 or 1980 Alphabetic
Index of Industries and Occupations, based on the kind of
business or industry at the location where the person
works. For unemployed persons, the industry code was
assigned on the basis of the last job held within 5
years. Industry coding was discontinued in March 1986.
See also: Occupation Code, Class or Worker, Major Activity
INJURY
Bodily hurt or damage sustained by a victim as a result of criminal
assault. The types of injuries suffered are used to distinguish
between serious and minor assaults. Serious injuries include knife or
gunshot wounds, broken bones, loss of teeth, and loss of
consciousness. A completed rape is classified as a serious
injury. Minor injuries include bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches,
swelling. Other injuries that can't be identified as serious or minor
are distinguished by the amount of hospitalization required. Injuries
suffered from an attack during a crime incident include any and all
PHYSICAL (bodily) damage experienced by the victim such as broken
bones, bruises, cuts, internal injuries, and so on. Emotional and
psychological trauma are not included.

INTERVIEW PERIOD
See: Enumeration Period
INTERVIEW PROCEDURES
Before the scheduled field interview, a letter informing each
household about the NCVS and the interviewer's impending visit is sent
to each sample unit. The initial contact between the interviewer and
the household is a personal visit, at which time interviews are
obtained for as many household members 12 years or older as
possible. For those eligible household members not interviewed during
the initial visit to the household, interviewers make telephone
callbacks to obtain interviews. During the initial interview,

- 510 -

- Study 34650 respondents are asked if they would be willing and able to conduct
subsequent interviews by phone. If they answer yes, all but the fifth
are done by phone. In 1987 computer-assisted telephone interviewing
(CATI) was used for some phone interviews. Since 2007 CATI has been
discontinued as a mode. Prior to March 1986, three of the seven interviews
(the second, fourth, and sixth) were done by phone whenever possible.
Prior to January 1980, all interviews were done face-to-face.

INTERVIEW, TYPE OF
The NCVS uses a combination of personal and telephone interviews, and
uses proxy interviews where necessary.
1) Personal Interviews: A face-to-face interview between survey
interviewer and respondent usually taking place in the
respondent's home. Each enumeration period, initial interviews
in a household are conducted in person. Follow-up interviews to
reach persons not available at the time of the initial visit may
be made by telephone.
2) Telephone Interviews: A telephone interview between survey field
representative and respondent. The respondent usually conducts
the interview from his/her home; the field representative may be
calling from a field office or from a centralized telephone
facility. Telephone interviewing is used to:
a) conduct interviews with respondents willing and able
to be interviewed over the telephone for all but the
first and fifth interview, and
b) conduct interviews with household members not
available for interview at the time of the initial
personal interview at the household
3) Self Respondent: A person who answers questions for
him/herself. Information about each household member is usually
obtained by self-response; that is, each of these persons is
interviewed for him/herself.
4) Proxy Respondent: A proxy respondent is a respondent who
answers questions for another person.
NCVS NOTE: Prior to July, 1986, information about each household
member aged 12 and 13 was obtained by asking the
questions for these persons of the household respondent
or some other knowledgeable household member.
Currently, unless a knowledgeable household member
objects, 12- and 13-year-olds are interviewed directly
by the interviewer. If a particular household member 12
or older is physically or mentally unable to answer the
individual questions, or is temporarily absent and is
not expected to return before the enumeration closeout
date, the interviewer is instructed to accept
information from another knowledgeable household member.

INTERVIEWING SEQUENCE
The general interview sequence for the NCVS is to:
1) Fill a Control Card for the Unit.
2) Interview the household respondent. This involves asking
all appropriate personal characteristics and Basic Screen
Questions (for the individual AND the household).
3) For each incident against the household or the
individual, an Incident Report is completed.
4) Interview all other eligible household members. This
involves asking all appropriate personal characteristics
and Basic Screen Questions (from the Individual Screen
section only)
5) For each incident reported by individual household
members, an incident report is filled out. An entire
interview is completed for a household member before
proceeding with the next person.

Questionnaire, Crime Incident Report
LAND USE
Designated as urban or rural, based on Census classification criteria.
Urban areas are places of 2,500 or more inhabitants incorporated as
cities, boroughs, villages, and towns (except towns in New England,
New York, and Wisconsin); the densely settled urban fringe, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, or urbanized areas; and unincorporated
places of 2,500 or more inhabitants. All remaining areas are classified
as rural.

LARCENY
See: Theft
LIFESTYLE
The Individual Screen Section begins with a series of questions on
lifestyle and frequency of behaviors that have shown some association
with crime victimization. Such behaviors include shopping, spending
the evening away from home, and riding public transportation.
(See: Individual Screen Section, Items 30, 31 and 32)
LINE NUMBER
A two-digit number assigned during the interview to identify each

- 512 -

- Study 34650 individual in a household. Line numbers serve to link Control Card
data to the Personal Characteristics data, and both of these to the
Incident Reports data.
LISTING
A procedure used to note the exact location of every place where
people live or might live within a given address or
segment. Interviewers record street names, house numbers, apartment
numbers, and unit locations. This list is then used to select sample
units randomly. In general, listing is done by observation guided by
detailed and extensive procedures, and varies somewhat depending on
the type of segment.
See also: Updating, Segment, Extra Units
LIVING QUARTERS
This is a general term for structures occupied or intended for human
occupancy. Living quarters are classified as either housing units or
OTHER units. Six types of housing units are distinguished for NCVS:
1) House, apartment, flat: includes such housing units as an
apartment over a garage or behind a store, janitor's
quarters in an office building, and housing units in
converted barns or sheds, as well as ordinary houses and
apartments.
2) Housing unit in a non-transient hotel, motel, etc. All
separate living quarters in non-transient hotels, motels,
etc., are housing units by definition.
3) Housing unit permanent in transient hotel, motel,
etc. Occupied or intended for occupancy by permanent
guests or resident employees.
4) Housing units in rooming house.
5) Mobile home or trailer: includes those with permanent
foundations.
6) Housing unit not specified above. Five types of OTHER
units are distinguished for NCVS:
1) Quarters, not housing unit, in rooming or boarding house.
2) Unit not permanent in transient hotel, motel, etc. Quarters
not occupied or intended for occupancy by permanent guests or
resident employees.
3) Vacant tent site or trailer site.
4) Student quarters in a college dormitory.
5) Not specified above (e.g.: quarters for nurses, quarters
in bunkhouses.

Transient/Nontransient, Place of Residence, Tenure
MARITAL STATUS
The NCVS defines five categories of marital status:
1) Married: includes common-law marriage
2) Widowed
3) Divorced
4) Separated: those married persons who have a legal
separation or who have parted because of marital discord,
but have not yet obtained a divorce. Those who have
parted temporarily for reasons other than marital discord
(such as employment, Armed Forces, etc.) are recorded as
married.
5) Never Married: includes all children under 14, and
persons who have never been married or whose only
marriages have been annulled.
MEDICAL CARE
Victims who were injured during an incident are asked whether they
received any medical care for their injuries.
NOTE: Prior to 1979, medical care included only treatment rendered
by trained professionals. In 1979 this was changed to include
paraprofessionals, non-professionals and self-treatment.
MEDICAL EXPENSES, TOTAL AMOUNT OF
This is the total amount of medical expenses which results directly
from the victim's injuries in the incident. Included are such items as
doctor and hospital bills, ambulance services, and any special devices
or aids the victim was forced to obtain as a result of the injury. If
the victim is still undergoing treatment for injuries related to the
incident, the total amount of medical expenses is an estimate of the
total projected medical expense.
METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines this as a population
nucleus of 50,000 or more, generally consisting of a city and its
immediate suburbs, along with adjacent communities having a high
degree of economic and social integration with the nucleus. MSAs are
designated by counties, the smallest geographic units for which a wide
range of statistical data can be obtained. However, in New England,
MSAs are designated by cities and towns since these subcounty units
are of great local significance and considerable data is available for
them. Currently, an area is defined as an MSA if it meets one of two
standards:
1) a city has a population of at least 50,000

- 514 -

- Study 34650 2) the Census Bureau defines an urbanized area of at least
50,000 people with a total metropolitan population of at
least 100,000 (or 75,000 in New England).
The Census Bureau's definition of urbanized areas, data on commuting
to work, and the strength of the economic and social ties between the
surrounding counties and the central city determine which counties not
containing a main city are included in an MSA. For New England, MSAs
are determined by a core area and related cities and towns, not
counties. A metropolitan statistical area may contain more than one
city of 50,000 and may cross State lines.
MILITARY STATUS
Determined for males and females 18-65 years of age. "In Armed Forces"
includes those serving on active duty at the time of the interview in
U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or the reserve
branch of any of the above only if currently on active duty status for
several months. Also includes commissioned officers of the U.S. Public
Health Service who are attached to any branch of the Armed Forces, and
National Guardsmen on active duty. Cadets in U.S. Military academies
also are considered to be with the Armed Forces.
MINOR ASSAULT
See: Robbery, Sexual Assault
MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT
Stealing or unauthorized taking of a motor vehicle, including
attempted thefts. A motor vehicle is defined as an automobile, truck,
motorcycle, or any other motorized vehicle legally allowed on public
roads or highways.
MOTOR VEHICLES, TOTAL NUMBER OF
All motor vehicles owned during the reference period are counted,
including those sold, given away, junked, stolen, or abandoned. Motor
vehicles used SOLELY by a recognizable business are not included, nor
are vehicles loaned to the respondent for private use by a business,
unless the respondent owns the business. Motor vehicles used by a
student, owned by his/her parents, and kept away from home are not
included.
MULTI-STAGE SAMPLING
A process used to select sample units. The NCVS sample was selected
using two stages. In the first stage, Primary Sampling Units (PSUs)
were selected. In the second stage, a sample of addresses was
selected within the sample PSUs. See "Sample Design" for a full
description.
See also: Primary Sampling Unit (PSU)
NCVS CRIME CLASSIFICATION SCHEME

- 515 -

- Study 34650 Crimes reported in the NCVS are classified using three main factors:
(1) Details respondents provide in the Incident Report
(2) Type of Crime Categories (see "CRIMES")
(3) Seriousness Hierarchy (see "CRIMES")
Details of the incident are reviewed in order to place the incident in
a Type of Crime Category. If the incident matches a category, that
Type of Crime code is assigned. If the incident fits more than one
Type of Crime category, the Seriousness Hierarchy is used to arrive at
a single Type of Crime code for each incident. An example of this is a
break-in that could be classified as both a burglary and an assault
(e.g.: if a resident encountered the burglar and was physically
assaulted). Assault is higher than Burglary on the Seriousness
Hierarchy, thus the incident would be coded as an Assault. However,
all details collected from the Incident Reports are preserved and
available for users to create their own classification scheme.
NON-INTERVIEW
For various reasons, interviewers are unable to obtain interviews for
all sample units. Such units are classified as non-interviews and are
handled as follows:
1) TYPE A: when an interview for an eligible household is
not obtained for some reason such as refusal. These
consist of households occupied by persons eligible for
interview but from whom no interviews are obtained
because:
a) no one is at home in spite of repeated visits
b) the entire household is temporarily away during all of
the interview period
c) the household refuses to give any information
d) the unit cannot be reached due to impassable roads
e) interview is not conducted due to a serious illness or
death in the family
f) the interviewer is unable to locate the sample unit.
Every effort is made to avoid this type of non-interview
in order to keep the unit and maintain a representative
sample. A Non-Interview adjustment is applied to
interviewed household and person weights so that Type A
units are represented in the sample.
2) TYPE B: when an interview is not obtained because the unit
is ineligible for interview at the present time (such as a
vacancy) but could become eligible in the future. These
consists of units which are not eligible for interview
because:

- 516 -

- Study 34650 a) unit is a vacant regular housing unit
b) unit is vacant and used for storage of household
furniture
c) unit is occupied by persons usually residing elsewhere
d) unit unfit for habitation or to be demolished
e) unit under construction and not ready for occupancy
f) unit temporarily converted to business or storage
g) address identifies an unoccupied tent or trailer site
h) permit granted but construction not started
i) household consists entirely of persons who are
ineligible for the survey. Since these units might
become eligible in the future, they are revisited in
subsequent periods that the unit is in the sample. If
they become eligible, the household is interviewed.
The sample size is sufficiently large to allow for Type B
Non-Interviews.
3) TYPE C: when the unit is physically ineligible. These
consist of units not eligible for sample because:
a) no address was listed on the sample line of the listing
sheet
b) unit demolished by time of enumeration
c) house or trailer has been moved
d) unit converted to permanent business or storage
e) unit has been merged with another unit
f) unit condemned and unoccupied
g) outside the segment boundary
h) built after April 1, 1980, 1990, 2000 (based on decennial
census)
i) permit was abandoned.
The sample size is sufficiently large to allow for Type C
Non-Interviews.
4) TYPE Z: when a particular member is not interviewed in an
otherwise interviewed household, i.e.: a within-household
non-interview. These occur when the interviewer is unable
to obtain an interview for a particular household member in

- 517 -

- Study 34650 an otherwise interviewed household, e.g., the person is
never available, refused, or is physically or mentally
unable to answer and no proxy is available. For this type
of non-interview person, only a few personal characteristic
items are filled in on the Basic Screen Questionnaire. A
Non-Interview adjustment is applied to interviewed person
weights to account for within-household non-interviews.
See also: Basic Screen Questionnaire
NON-INTERVIEW/NON-RESPONSE ADJUSTMENTS
Adjustments made to the weights of interviewed households and persons
in order to compensate for those households and persons not
interviewed. A household non-interview adjustment accounts for
occupied sample units qualified to participate in the survey, but from
which an interview was not obtained (Type A Non-Interview). A
within-household non-interview adjustment accounts for eligible
persons who were not interviewed in an interviewed household (Non Type
Z Non-Interview.) See section - Weight for a full description.
See also: Household Weight, Person Weight, Final Weight
OCCUPIED HOUSING UNIT
A housing unit is considered occupied if it is the usual place of
residence of the person or persons living in it at the time of the
interview.
See also: Place of Residence, Housing Unit
OFFENDER
The person(s) who committed or was/were believed by the respondent to
have committed the crime.
OPERATION OF BUSINESS
For the purposes of the NCVS, a distinction is made between two types
of businesses: recognizable and unrecognizable. A recognizable
business is one that is observable and identifiable from the outside
by a sign or some other indication. Crimes involving any recognizable
business, such as property stolen from the business, are not included
in the NCVS. Only the loss of personal property of the respondent or
of another household member, or personal threat or injury to the
respondent or other household member(s) is included if a crime
involves a recognizable business. An unrecognizable business has no
outside identification, such as a sign in the yard or window, which
indicates that it is a business. An example of an unrecognizable
business is a mail order business run from the home, if there is no
sign outside the house advertising the business. Crimes involving
unrecognizable businesses, including property stolen from the
business, are included in the NCVS estimates.
OTHER UNITS
Refers to living quarters which do not qualify as housing units. OTHER

- 518 -

- Study 34650 units are located in special places such as institutions, dormitories,
and boarding houses where the residents have their own rooms, groups
of rooms, or beds, and also have some common facilities such as a
dining room, lobby, or living room or recreational areas. Some of the
rooms, groups of rooms, etc., in these places are always classified as
OTHER units, even though they have direct access or complete kitchen
facilities. Other rooms or groups of rooms are classified as OTHER
units if they do NOT meet the housing unit definition. All units in
the NCVS sample are defined as either being a housing unit or an OTHER
unit.
See also: Housing Unit, Living Quarters, Special Places, Group
Quarters, Extra Units
OUT OF UNIVERSE
Out of Universe (or INAP) is used in the codebook documentation to
designate those items on the questionnaire that were not appropriate
for certain respondents (based on information gathered throughout the
interview) and therefore should not have been asked. For example,
hospital tenure questions are not asked of victims who were not
injured.
See also: Residue
PANEL
A systematically selected group of sample units comprising one-sixth
of the entire NCVS sample. Each panel is interviewed twice per year
(at six-month intervals, e.g.: January and July) for three years total
during the panel's time in sample.
See also: Sample Rotation
PANEL NUMBER
In the National Sample, an identification number (l-6) assigned to
each case in the sample identifying the months in which the unit is to
be interviewed (e.g., Panel 1 housing units are interviewed in January
and July ). The panel number is the first digit of the segment number.

PERSON WEIGHT
A variable associated with each person in the sample to provide an
estimate of the population represented by each person. The person
weight is calculated as the product of six factors, whose values
depend on the characteristics of the household or the person:

PERSONAL CRIMES
See: Personal Incident, Personal Victimization.
PERSONAL INCIDENT
A specific criminal act involving one or more persons as victims of
one or more offenders. The NCVS defines crimes against persons as
rape, sexual assault, robbery, simple or aggravated assault, and
purse-snatching\pocket-picking. The NCVS makes a general distinction
between an Incident and a Victimization. The number of victimizations
reflects how many criminal acts were experienced by NCVS survey
respondents; the number of incidents reflects the number of criminal
acts committed against NCVS survey respondents and others present
during such incidents as reported by survey respondents. If there were
more than one victim, the incident weight is adjusted to compensate
for the possibility that the incident could be reported several times
by multiple victims and thus be over-counted. For example, if a survey
respondent and two other people (non-respondents) were robbed during the
same incident, the NCVS counts this as one-third of a personal
incident but one victimization. If all victims were respondents, this
criminal act would be counted as one incident and three
victimizations. Therefore, estimates of the number of personal
incidents are usually lower than estimates of personal victimizations.
See also: Personal Victimization, Victimization, Incident Weight
PERSONAL INTERVIEWS
See: Interview, Type of
PERSONAL VICTIMIZATION
A specific criminal act as it affects one victimized person. The NCVS
defines crimes against persons as rape, sexual assault, robbery,
simple or aggravated assault, and pursesnatching/pocket-picking. Estimates of the number of personal
victimizations are determined by the number of victims of such acts as
reported by the survey respondent. Ordinarily, the number of
victimizations is somewhat higher than the number of incidents because
more than one person may be victimized during certain incidents, and
because details of personal crimes occurring during the course of a
commercial crime, as related to the victimized person, are reflected
in these estimates.
See also: Personal Incident, Victimization, Incident
PLACE
The term place refers to a concentration of population, regardless of
the existence of legally prescribed units, powers, or
functions. However, most of the places identified in the census are

- 520 -

- Study 34650 incorporated as cities, towns, villages, or boroughs. In addition, the
larger unincorporated places are identified as places. Places are

crimes in its annual report.
NCVS NOTE: Prior to January 1993, enclosed and unenclosed
porch were not explicitly asked.
PLACE OF RESIDENCE

POLICE INFORMED
A question on the Crime Incident Report asks: "Were the police
informed of this incident in any way?" The "police" include all
regular police and sheriff's departments at the city, county, state,
or federal level of government. Also included are specialized police
forces authorized to make arrests in a special area or jurisdiction,
e.g., campus police, park police, transit police, harbor police, and
airport police. Excluded are security guards, fish and game wardens,
and such officers without authority to make police arrests.

PRIMARY SAMPLING UNIT (PSU)
Survey estimates are based on data obtained from a stratified,
multi-stage cluster sample. The primary sampling units (PSUs)
composing the first stage of the sampling were counties, groups of
counties, or large metropolitan areas. Large PSUs were included in the
sample automatically and are considered to be self-representing
(SR). The remaining PSUs, called non-self-representing (NSR), were
combined into strata by grouping PSUs with similar demographic
characteristics, as determined by the census. One PSU was selected
from each stratum by making the probability of selection proportionate
to the population of the PSU. The current design consists of 84 SR and
153 NSR PSUs. Since July 1986, the PSU is scrambled with four other
elements into a control number, to preserve confidentiality.
See: Control Number
PRINCIPAL PERSON
In husband/wife living arrangements, this person is the wife. In
non-husband/wife living arrangements, this person is the reference
person. The principal person's demographic characteristics are used in
forming the household weight.
See also: Head of Household, Household Respondent
PROPERTY CRIME
Property crimes include burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft. The
category includes both attempted and completed crimes. Property crime
corresponds roughly to the NCS classification of Household Crime,
except that crimes formerly classed as personal larceny without
contact are now classed as thefts and thus property crimes. The
household weight is the correct weight to use with any property crime.

- 523 -

- Study 34650 PROPERTY VICTIMIZATION
A specific criminal act that may be classified as a property
crime. Each criminal act against a household is considered to involve
a single victim: the affected household. If any household member is
attacked or threatened during the crime, it is considered a personal
crime, and reports are taken from each person who was personally
victimized. Typically, property victimizations are reported by the
Household Respondent. However, any interviewed member may report
property crimes in response to individual screen questions.
See also: Personal Victimization, Household Screen Question
PSU NUMBERS
"PSU numbers" are three-digit codes which identify each PSU, and are
part of the Control Number which uniquely identifies each sample
unit. For purposes of confidentiality, these numbers have been
scrambled on the public use tapes.
PROXY RESPONDENT

PURSE-SNATCHING
Theft or attempted theft of properties or cash directly from the
victim by stealth without force or threat of force.
QUESTIONNAIRE FORMS
There are three basic forms used to collect the data required for
the NCVS:
1) Control Card
2) Basic Screen Questionnaire (Personal Characteristics,
Household and Individual Screen Sections)
3) Crime Incident Report

RACE
Respondent's self-reported race. The five categories are: White,
Black, American Indian/Aleut/Eskimo, Asian/Pacific Islander, and
Other.
See also: Ethnicity
RACE OF OFFENDER

- 524 -

- Study 34650 The race of offender as perceived and reported by the
respondent. Categories are White, Black, American Indian or Alaska
Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and Don't
know. When recording the racial designation(s) of multiple offenders,
categories are: Mostly White, Mostly Black, Mostly American Indian or
Alaska Native, Mostly Asian, Mostly Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander, Equal number of each race, and Don't Know.
NCVS NOTE: Categories of race of offender (single and multiple)
were modified in 1986.
Categories of race of offender (single and multiple)
were expanded in 2012 to add American Indian or Alaska
Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander.
RAPE
One of the six major types of crime covered by the NCVS, rape is
defined as:
"Forced sexual intercourse and includes both psychological
coercion as well as physical force. Forced sexual
intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the
offender(s). This category also includes incidents where
the penetration is from a foreign object such as a bottle."
Respondents are asked a series of questions in the Basic Screen
Section about attack, rape, attempted rape, sexual attack, and forced
or coerced unwanted sex. These questions are asked directly and are
accompanied by cues about the offender (casual acquaintance,
co-worker, neighbor, friend, relative, etc.). If the respondent
replies in the affirmative to any of these questions or cues, an
Incident Report is filled out to gather details. In gathering these
details, interviewers are instructed to ask "Do you mean forced or
coerced sexual intercourse?" to determine whether the incident should
be recorded as a rape. If the respondent requests clarification of the
terms "rape" or "sexual intercourse", interviewers may read the
definition from the manual above.
NCVS NOTE: Prior to January 1993, the Basic Screen Questionnaire
did not ask direct questions about rape and related
sexual attacks. Rapes may have been reported in response
to any screen question, especially those which asked
about attacks, threats, and attempted attacks. Since the
questions did not ask directly about rape, it was up to
the respondent to acknowledge any such incidents as
warranting "yes" responses and to specify that a rape
occurred in response to questions on the incident
form. Rape sub-categories included completed and
attempted rape only. Beginning in January 1993, the
categories of rape and sexual attack were expanded. See
the NCVS Redesign document in the NCVS Resource Guide
(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS)
for a complete discussion of these changes.

RECOGNIZABLE BUSINESS
See: Operation of Business
REFERENCE PERIOD
The period of time for which respondents are asked to recall
victimizations experienced. The NCVS uses a reference period of six
months. For crime tabulation purposes, the reference period is exactly
six months ending on the last day of the month prior to the interview;
for data collection purposes, the length of the reference period
varies slightly, depending on the exact day of interview. For example,
for interviews taking place in July, the reference period for
tabulating victimizations is January 1 through June 30. For data
collection purposes, respondents are asked to report on incidents
beginning January 1 and ending on the day prior to interview. In cases
where victimizations are reported as having occurred during the month
in which the interview takes place, an Incident Report is filled out
but the data on the victimization(s) are held and tabulated with
crimes reported in the following reference period (in this case, July
1 through January 31).

REFERENCE PERSON
The person identified by the household respondent as owning, buying,
or renting the living quarters. This person will generally be at least
18 years of age or older; however, if no one in the household is 18
years of age, the interviewer will choose the person who is identified
as owning or renting the living quarters. The reference person
replaces the former concept of "head of household" and is not
necessarily the same as the household respondent or principal person.

REINTERVIEW
A reinterview is a second interview of a previously interviewed sample
unit, with the purpose of evaluating some aspect of the original
interview. It re-asks a small subsample of the original respondents
all or a portion of the questions from the original interview and
refers to the same time point as the original interview. For NCVS, a
member of the supervisory staff or a supervisory field representative
conducts the reinterview and compares the reinterview answers to the
original answers. The reinterviewer uses this comparison primarily to
detect and deter falsification. Falsification occurs when field
representatives intentionally falsify interviews or misclassify
noninterviews. The reinterviewer can also use reinterview data to do
the following:

- 526 -

- Study 34650 1) Detect system-wide problems. For example, inadequate
training, deficient procedures, and poor questionnaire
design
2) Monitor interviewer performance, give feedback, and
decide when an interviewer needs additional training.
RELATIONSHIP TO REFERENCE PERSON
Once interviewers have established the reference person in a
household, other household members are identified by their precise
relationship to the reference person, e.g., wife, husband, son,
daughter, step-son, step-daughter, father, mother, grandson,
daughter-in-law, aunt, nephew, lodger, servant, hired hand, visitor,
and so on.

RESIDENCE

RESIDUE
Used in the codebook documentation to designate those cases where the
respondent could not or did not provide an answer, or for some reason
the response given did not fall into the predetermined
categories. Attempts were made during the edits to convert such cases
into valid codes based on the presence or absence of certain key
elements.

RESPONDENT
A person selected to be part of the NCVS sample who participates in
the survey.
See also: Interview, Type of
RESPONSE RATE
The rate at which selected sample units participated in the
survey. The response rate is generally calculated by dividing the
number of sample units participating in the survey by the number of
sample units selected.
ROBBERY
One of the six major crime categories, robbery is defined as completed
or attempted theft, directly from a person, of property or cash by
force or threat of force, with or without a weapon. There are two main
subcategories of robbery: WITH INJURY and WITHOUT INJURY. ROBBERY WITH
INJURY is theft or attempted theft from a person, accompanied by an
attack, either with or without a weapon, resulting in injury. ROBBERY
WITH INJURY may be further classified as occurring with serious or
minor assault. As used in the NCVS classification hierarchy, SERIOUS

- 527 -

- Study 34650 ASSAULT is a form of assaultive violence in which the attack is either
carried out with a weapon, or results in serious injury, such as
broken bones, internal injuries, loss of consciousness, or an
undetermined injury requiring 2 or more days of hospitalization. This
definition is equivalent to that for aggravated assault, except that
an aggravated assault is classified when other forms of victimization,
such as theft of property or sexual attack, are not present during the
same incident. An injury is classified as resulting from a MINOR
ASSAULT if it is the consequence of an attack carried out without a
weapon and results in minor injury, such as bruises, black eye, cuts,
and scratches or an undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of
hospitalization. This definition is equivalent to that for completed
simple assault, except that a completed simple assault is classified
when other, more serious forms of victimization are not present during
the same incident.

ROTATION DESIGN
See: Sample Rotation, Rotation Group Number
ROTATION GROUP NUMBER
A number used to place the sample unit in the rotation scheme. The
rotation group number is denoted by the hundreds digit of the
four-digit segment number assigned to each sample unit. Each rotation
group is a systematic one-sixth sample of all current NCVS housing
units as well as a one-sixth sample of the sample interviewed each
month.
See also: Segment Number, Sample Rotation
RURAL
All remaining areas not falling into one of the following categories:
1) Places of 2,500 or more inhabitants incorporated into
cities, boroughs, villages, and towns (except towns in
New England, New York, Wisconsin)
2) Densely settled urban areas
3) Unincorporated places of 2,500 or more inhabitants.

SAMPLE

- 528 -

- Study 34650 A selection of units of a population from which estimates about the
general population are made. If sample units are chosen according to
laws of probability and randomization, inferences may be made from the
sample to the general population within specified margins of
error. For the NCVS a stratified cluster sample was used whereby each
element of the population has a known chance of being included in the
sample, allowing such inference to be made.
See also: Estimate
SAMPLE DESIGNATION
A portion of the identification codes assigned to each sample unit in
the NCVS, consisting of the letter "J" and two digits. The letter
distinguishes NCVS surveys from other Census surveys, and the digits
identify the sequence and source of selection of sample addresses. For
example, the first sample selected was designated as J01.
See also: Identification Code, Control Number
SAMPLE ROTATION
The following rotation scheme is used for the NCVS: each sample of
approximately 50,000 households is divided into six rotation
groups. When the rotation plan became fully operative in January 1977,
households in a particular rotation group and sample were interviewed
once every six months for three years, the first interview being
only for the purpose of bounding. Each rotation group is further
divided into six panels or months. Thus l/6th of each rotation group
is interviewed each month during a six-month period. One rotation
group enters the sample every six months, while the corresponding
rotation group from a previous sample is phased out. This enables
preservation of the overall sample size and survey procedures while
averting undue imposition to, and biases in, reporting by respondents
through repeated interviews.

- 529 -

- Study 34650 A string of clusters of sample units in the same PSU selected to be
part of the NCVS sample. Sample units are located in one type of
segment, depending on the type of Enumeration District in which the
segment is located:
1) Address Segments consist of completely recorded specific
addresses selected from the Decennial Census list, in
address type Enumeration Districts.
2) Special Place Segments consist of special places (e.g.:
dormitories, rooming houses) in address type Enumeration
districts which can be identified from Census listings.
3) Area Segments consist of relatively small designated
areas of land with well-defined boundaries, such as
streets, roads, rivers, or railroad tracks in area type
Enumeration Districts. The interviewer lists all of the
living quarters in a designated segment, and a sample of
these is selected for interview.
4) New Construction Segments represent units built since
the Census.

units digits together (the serial number) identify clusters which are
numbered sequentially starting with "01" in each panel and rotation
combination. Since July 1986, the segment number has been scrambled

SERIES INCIDENT REPORT
Six or more incidents similar in nature for which the respondent is
unable to recall dates and other details of the individual incidents
well enough to report them separately. If a reported series of
incidents meets this description the following information is
recorded:
1) The incident is marked as a series crime.
2) An estimate of the number of times the incident occurred
is asked of the respondent.
3) Details of the most recent incident in the series are
gathered in the Crime Incident Report.
4) Information on the nature of the series is gathered
(e.g.: how many times the incident occurred, whether all
incidents occurred in the same place, the victim/offender
relationship, how similar the incidents were to each
other, and whether the problem persists).
NCVS NOTE: Prior to January 1993, series crimes were defined as
three or more incidents similar in nature for which the
respondent was unable to recall dates and other details
separately for each incident. Also, details described in
point #3 were added.
See the NCVS Redesign document in the NCVS Resource Guide
(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS)for a
description of this redefinition.
SERIOUS ASSAULT
See: Robbery, Sexual Assault
SERIOUSNESS HIERARCHY
See: Crimes, NCVS Crime Classification Scheme
SEXUAL ASSAULT
A wide range of victimizations, separate from rape or attempted
rape. These crimes include attacks or attempted attacks generally
involving (unwanted) sexual contact between victim and
offender. Sexual assaults may or may not involve force, such as

- 531 -

- Study 34650 grabbing or fondling, for example and may also include verbal
threats. Sexual assaults resulting in injury are further classified by
the seriousness of the attack. A sexual assault with SERIOUS ASSAULT
is a form of assaultive violence in which the attack is either carried
out with a weapon, or results in serious injury, such as broken bones,
internal injuries, loss of consciousness, or an undetermined injury
requiring 2 or more days of hospitalization. This definition is
equivalent to that for aggravated assault, except that an aggravated
assault is classified when other forms of victimization, such as theft
of property or sexual attack, are not present during the same
incident. A sexual attack with MINOR ASSAULT is the classification of
an attack carried out without a weapon and which results in minor
injury, such as bruises, black eye, cuts, and scratches or an
undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of
hospitalization. This definition is equivalent to that for completed
simple assault, except that a completed simple assault is classified
when other, more serious forms of victimization are not present during
the same incident.

SPECIAL PLACE SEGMENT
See: Segment
SPECIAL PLACE
Places in which the occupants have special living arrangements.
Special places include: correctional institutions; homes for the aged,
infirm, or needy; mental institutions; nursing, convalescent, or rest
homes; specialized hospitals; Armed Forces installations; boarding and
rooming houses; convents and monasteries; dormitories and other
residences at schools; missions; halfway houses; hotels and motels;
nurse's homes; private residential clubs and tourist camps;
recreational, educational and religious camps; tent and trailer camps;
migratory workers' camps; vacation cabins; YMCAs and YWCAs; and so
on. Special places may include housing units and OTHER units. For
example, a dormitory consisting of rooms for students and an apartment
for a resident manager would include both OTHER units and a housing
unit. Living quarters within special places are designated as either
Staff Units, Non-staff Units, or Unclassified Units, as determined by
occupancy or intended occupancy. Non-staff Units are located in
certain special places and are defined as the persons for whom the
special places are being operated, OR the units in which these persons
live, such as rooms or suites or rooms. Non-staff units are never
interviewed for the NCVS. Staff Units are located in the same types of
places which contain Non-staff Units and are defined as the houses,
apartments, rooms, or suites of rooms occupied or intended for
occupancy by resident employees and their families, if
any. Unclassified Units are located in certain special places and are
the houses, apartments, rooms, etc. occupied or intended to be
occupied by all persons. Staff Units and Unclassified Units are
interviewed.

STANDARD ERROR
An expression of sampling error which states the amount of deviation
of an estimate because a sample was drawn instead of a census
taken. Standard error is a measure of how precise the sample estimate
is compared to the true value that would have been obtained if the
entire population was measured. A measure of standard error is
calculated in the following way: under any given sample design, there
are many possible samples of the same size that could be drawn. In
theory, each of these possible samples could actually be drawn,
estimates could be calculated for each, and the average of these
estimates could be computed. The difference between the estimate
derived from the sample that actually was drawn and the average of the
estimate calculated if all possible samples were drawn is called
sampling deviation. The standard error of a sample estimate is a
measure of the variation among these estimates from all possible
samples, and thus is a measure of the precision with which an estimate
from a particular sample approximates the average result of all
possible samples. An estimate of the standard error of a sample
estimate can be computed from the data obtained in the sample.

STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (SMSA)
See: Metropolitan Statistical Area
STRATA
Groups of Non-self-representing (NSR) PSUs which have specified
characteristics in common. The process of making these groupings is
called stratification. NSR PSUs were stratified by combining PSUs with
similar population characteristics which include:
1) Crime rate (based on Uniform Crime Report data from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation)
2) Percent urban
3) Average value of owned housing units
4) Average rent of rented housing units
TARGET POPULATION
The population that sample estimates are designed to describe. The
NCVS estimates crime levels and victimization rates for the population
of households and of individuals 12 years of age and older living in
households and group quarters in the United States and the District of
Columbia. Excluded are persons who are crews of vessels, in
institutions (e.g., prisons and nursing homes), or members of the
armed forces living in military barracks.

TENURE
Manner in which living quarters are held.
1) Owned or being bought: if owner or co-owner is a
household member of the unit, even if the unit is
mortgaged or not fully paid for. Owner need not be head
of household. A cooperative apartment or condominium unit
is owned or being bought only if the owner lives in it.
2) Rented for cash: if any money rent is paid or contracted
for by any persons.
3) Without cash rent: Includes units not owned, being
bought, or rented for cash; usually provided in exchange
for services or as a gift.
See also: Living Quarters
THEFT
Completed or attempted theft of property or cash without personal
contact. Incidents involving theft of property from within the same
household would classify as theft if the offender has a legal right to
be in the house (such as a maid, delivery person, or guest). If the
offender has no legal right to be in the house, the incident would
classify as a burglary. Theft is classified as a property crime, and
the household weight should be used for estimates. This definition
applies only from January 1993. Before that date, theft was classified
as household (household larceny) or personal (personal larceny without
contact, personal larceny with contact, i.e., pocket-picking or
purse-snatching). The primary distinguishing attribute of personal and
household larceny was location, with thefts away from the home classed
as personal and thefts at home defined as household.

THREAT
A threatening situation is one in which there was no physical contact
between the offender and victim but the victim felt that physical harm
could have occurred. This includes nonverbal threats, e.g.,
brandishing a weapon, and verbal threats of physical harm which are
made in person. Threats made over the telephone or threatening letters
are not included.
See also: Attack
TIME LOST FROM WORK
Number of cumulative days all affected household members were absent
from work due to a crime. It can be time lost because injuries
sustained in the incident kept the victim from returning to work

- Study 34650 immediately, or time taken off work by a household member to do things
related to the incident such as visiting a doctor, reporting the
incident to the police, seeing a insurance agent, or testifying in
court. Since 1979, victims are asked in more detail about their work
time losses.
TRANSIENT/NONTRANSIENT
A transient place is a special place in which more than 25 percent of
the rooms, suites, or cabins are occupied or intended for occupancy by
transient guests. Transient guests usually stay less than a month and
pay at daily rates. A nontransient place is one in which 75 percent or
more of the rooms, suites, or cabins are occupied or intended for
occupancy by nontransient (permanent) guest or resident
employees. Permanent guests usually stay a month or more at reduced
monthly or weekly rates.

VICTIM
In the NCVS, the person or household involved in a criminal act during
the specified reference period, for whom an Incident Report was
completed.
See also: Victimization
VICTIM-OFFENDER RELATIONSHIP
The respondent is asked to specify one of six broad categories
indicating how well the victim knew the offender in a crime incident
in which the victim was present:
1) Stranger: someone the victim had never seen before
2) By sight only: someone the victim had seen before, but
had not said more than "hello" to
3) Casual acquaintance: someone the victim knew well enough
to say more than "hello" to
4) Well-known: someone the victim had considered as
such. The victim's judgment alone distinguishes between
"casual acquaintances" and "well known". Well-known
offenders are classified as relatives or non-relatives.
5) Relative: by type of relationship. Subcategories are:
a) spouse at times of incident
b) ex-spouse at time of incident
c) parent or step-parent
d) own child or step-child
e) brother/sister
f) other relative (specified by respondent)
1979 NOTE: The category "ex-spouse" was added as a separate

VICTIMIZATION
A specific criminal act as it affects a single victim. In criminal
acts against persons, the number of victimizations is determined by
the number of victims of such acts. Each criminal act against a
household is assumed to involve a single victim, the affected
household.
See also: Crimes, Incident, Victim, Victimization Rate, Household
Victimization, Personal Victimization
VICTIMIZATION RATE
A measure of crime occurrence among population groups at risk. Rates
can be calculated for the general population (e.g.: the number of
criminal victimizations per 1,000 persons or households) or for any
crime type and demographic measure (e.g.: the number of burglaries per
1,000 urban households or the number of robberies per 1,000 males). As
used in BJS publications:
1) For crimes against persons, the victimization rate is
computed on the basis of the number of victimizations per
1,000 resident population age 12 and over
2) For crimes against households, victimization rates are
calculated on the basis of the number of incidents per
1,000 households. See the separate note on computation of
rates.
See also: Weight, Victimization
WEAPON
Items such as guns (pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, etc.) and
knives are always considered weapons. Other objects are not considered
weapons unless they are used as weapons; if the respondent felt
threatened by the object, then it is considered a weapon. The
following items are not considered as weapons for the purposes of the
NCVS: mace, tear gas, items of food, small empty cans, animals, parts
of the body, BB and tear gas guns (except when used as clubs). Weapons
other than guns or knives, e.g., rocks, clubs, etc., are not
individually identifiable in the data files.
WEIGHT
A factor applied to a sample element that allows computation of the

- 538 -

- Study 34650 size of the population the element represents. When a sample is
interviewed, each incident or victimization represents a probable
percentage of all cases if the total population were to be
interviewed. Accordingly, each case is assigned a numerical
coefficient, or weight, expressing its relative importance in a
frequency distribution equaling that of the sample to the whole. Thus,
multiplying each case by its assigned weight and summing over all
cases provides an estimate of the entire population. Because there are
different proportions in the samples of households, persons and
incidents with respect to all possible households, persons, and
incidents in the surveys, there are different weights for each.

- Study 34650 Census Sample Information and NCS/NCVS Rotation Chart
Text:

CENSUS SAMPLE INFORMATION
In the National Crime Victimization Survey, the samples are identified
by the letter "J" and a two-digit number. The letter distinguishes NCVS
surveys from other Census surveys and the digits identify the sequence
and source of selection of sample addresses. The body of the rotation
chart below contains a series of two-digit numbers. The tens digits is
the panel number and the units digit is the rotation number.
Therefore, you should read across the rows for a change in rotation,
and down the columns for a change in panel number.
As an example a rotation group is introduced semi-annually for the new
sample, e.g., in sample J16 rotation 3 will be introduced in the
period January - June 1992 and rotation 4 in the period July December 1992. However, the corresponding rotation group will not be
dropped from the earlier samples until the next enumeration
period. Therefore, sample units in rotation 3 of sample J16 will be
enumerated for the first time in the period January - June 1992 and
sample units in rotation 3 of sample J15 will be enumerated for the
last time during that period.

NCVS SAMPLE ROTATION INFORMATION AND ROTATION CHART
The NCVS sample is rotated to guard against respondent fatigue. The
total sample of approximately 50,000 households is divided into 6
sub-groups. The households will be interviewed 7 times over the course
of three years. After the seventh interview, the rotation group leaves
the sample and is replaced by a new group of respondent households.
Thus, every 6 months, a rotation group is dropped from the sample, and
a rotation group is added to the sample. During any given 6 month period,
7 rotational groups are interviewed.
Prior to 2006 the first interviews, the bounding inteviews, are excluded
from the NCVS data files. During 2006 and 2007 the first interviews
began being phased-in to the NCVS data files. Starting in 2008 all
first interview are included in the NCVS data files.
Each of the rotation groups are divided in 6 panels. Each panel is
interviewed in a different month during the 6 month period. Spreading
the interviewing across the 6 month period significantly reduces the
survey costs by reducing the number of interviews that must be
collected at the same time.
The assignments of rotation and panel groups are made to segments of
housing units. Each rotation and panel group is a systematic subsample
of the total sample. Rotation groups are also systematic subsamples of
the sample interviewed each month.

- Study 34650 Crime Estimate Details
Text:

The method of producing estimates of victimization is different
depending on whether the DATA-YEAR or COLLECTION-YEAR format is used.
To produce rates of victimization under the COLLECTION-YEAR format,
one only needs to identify the year that the interview was conducted.
Producing estimates of victimization under the DATA-YEAR format is
more complicated. Under the DATA-YEAR format, adjustments must be
made to account for the rotational period of the sample design and the
reported date of the incident. The table below shows the relationship
between collection month and the related reference months.

The above table illustrates the collection month from which
information about a given calendar or reference year may be drawn due
to the six-month bounding period. For this reason, a respondent may
report a victimization incident which occurred up to six months before

- 545 -

- Study 34650 the time of the interview. When producing DATA-YEAR victimization
estimates, one must identify incidents occurring in the reference
year. To identify all the incidents which occurred in a reference
year, all the incidents reported as having occurred before the
beginning of that year must be excluded. Also, all the incidents
reported in the following year as having occurred before the end of
the reference year must be identified.
Under the COLLECTION-YEAR format, when the interview is conducted
determines when the victimization is counted.

- Study 34650 Questionnaire Details
Text:

QUESTIONNAIRE PARTS
Rather than asking a simple yes/no question ("Have you been victimized
by crime?"), the NCVS questionnaire is made up of two parts: the
"Screening Section" and the "Incident Report." The Screening Section
describes criminal incidents using everyday language in order to
ascertain whether the respondent has been victimized during the six
months prior to interview. Any positive responses are followed by an
Incident Report, a series of detailed questions on the incident
itself. The screening section is a series of questions and cues
describing various behaviors and features of a criminal incident. For
example, to elicit reports of aggravated assault one screen question
asks: "Has anyone attacked or threatened you in any of these ways:
with any weapon, for instance, a gun or knife; with anything like a
baseball bat, frying pan, scissors, or stick, by something thrown,
such as a rock or bottle..." Because the NCVS measures both property
and personal crime, a separate Screening Section is administered for
each. The Household Respondent (see Glossary p. 493)
is asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole
(e.g. burglary, motor vehicle theft) as well as personal crimes against
him/herself. Other members of the household are asked only about personal
crimes, although if they report crimes against the household not already
reported by the Household Respondent an Incident Report is filled out.
If any Household or Individual screen question elicits a positive
response, an Incident Report is filled out to gather details of the
victimization. The incident report is designed to obtain detailed
data on the characteristics and circumstances of the
victimization. Items such as time and place of occurrence, injuries
suffered, medical expenses incurred, number, age, race, and sex of
offenders, relationship of offenders to victim (stranger, casual
acquaintance, relative, etc.), and other detailed data relevant to a
complete description of the incident are included in the report. This
information is used during subsequent computer processing to determine
whether the incident fits into one of the crimes within the scope of
the survey and to place the incident in the appropriate category (see
Glossary p. 493 for NCVS Crime Classification
Schemes and Crimes).

FIELD REPRESENTATIVES
Field representatives' (FRs) instructions are explicit and detailed
concerning the administration of the questionnaires, adherence to
question wording, and the use of probes. The questions and all short
cues accompanying the questions are read in full. Field
representatives are instructed to read these questions and cues only,
and offer response categories only as a last resort. Field
representatives are explicitly instructed to avoid reading the answer
categories for the question, "How were you threatened?" if at all
possible. Residue is used in the codebook documentation to designate
those cases where the respondent could not or did not provide an

- 549 -

- Study 34650 answer, or for some reason the response given did not fall into the
predetermined categories.
Field representatives receive extensive training prior to any
field work. The quality of interviewing is maintained by
periodic direct observation of all field representatives,
office edits of completed work, and verification of their work
by re-interviewing a sample of completed sample units. FRs also
measure errors in coverage of the population resulting from
missing units, incorrect address listing, etc. The Bureau of
the Census circulates a series of periodic updates dealing with
the field procedures followed by the National Crime
Victimization Survey field representatives.

- Study 34650 Weights Details
Text:
Weight variables are used extensively in the National Crime
Victimization Survey data. This section describes the components of
the weighting variables, as well as caveats regarding weights and
deriving longitudinally representative data.

COMPONENTS OF WEIGHTS
The final weight (household, V2116; person, V3080; or incident, V4527)
adjusts for unequal probabilities of selection and observation, and
for known age, sex, and race ratios based on the Adjusted Decennial
Census Population Totals. Specifically, the final person and incident
weights are the product of the values of the following six components
weights. Household weights exclude the within-household non-interview
adjustment.
1. BASE WEIGHT: The inverse of the national sampling rate for the
stratum of that unit (person or household).
2. WEIGHTING CONTROL FACTOR: Adjusts for any sub-sampling due to
unexpected events in the field, such as new construction, area
segments larger than anticipated, and other deviations from the
overall stratum sampling rate.
3. HOUSEHOLD NON-INTERVIEW ADJUSTMENT: Adjusts for nonresponse at the
household-level by increasing the weights of interviewed households
most similar to households not interviewed in terms of race, MSA
status of residence, and urban/suburban/rural status of
residence. This inflates the weight value assigned to interviewed
households so that they represent themselves and non-interviewed
households. The non-interviewed cases are assigned a weight of zero,
thereby excluding them from population estimates.
4. WITHIN-HOUSEHOLD NON-INTERVIEW ADJUSTMENT: Adjusts for
non-response at the person-level by increasing the weight of
interviewed persons most similar to persons not interviewed in terms
of region, age, race, sex, and household composition. The adjustment
inflates the weight value assigned to completed interviews, so that
they represent themselves and sampled individuals who were not
interviewed. The non-interviewed cases are assigned a weight of zero.
5. FIRST STAGE RATIO ESTIMATES FACTOR: Adjusts for differences
between characteristics of the sample non-self-representing (NSR)
primary sampling units (PSUs) and independent measures of the
population NSR PSUs. (For self-representing PSUs this factor is set
to 1). This factor adjusts for PSU differences on region, MSA status,
urban/suburban/rural status, and racial composition.
6. SECOND STAGE RATIO ESTIMATE FACTOR: A post-stratification factor
defined for each person to adjust for the difference between weighted
counts of persons (using the above five weight components) and
independent estimates of the number of persons, within certain age by
race by sex categories. These independent estimates are based on the

- 551 -

- Study 34650 Census population controls adjusted for the undercount.
The weights discussed above (household, V2116; person, V3080; and
incident, V4527) are not the same as the adjusted household, person,
and victimization weights. The adjusted weights, both collection-year
and data-year versions, were calculated using V2116 and V3080 as
necessary. It is the adjusted weights for households, persons, and
victimizations (WGTHHCY, WGTHHDY, WGTPERCY, WGTPERDY, WGTVICCY, and
WGTVICDY) that should be used to directly calculate counts of
households, persons, and victimizations on either a collection-year or
data-year basis.

WEIGHTING AND DERIVING LONGITUDINALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA
Not only are weights useful for calculating cross-sectional estimates,
but they play a crucial role in ensuring that any analysis of NCVS
data over time is accurate. When the analyst plans to compare NCVS
data across time, it is important to bear in mind the following
cautions regarding the use of weights and unweighted data:
The NCVS sample size has fluctuated over the years, particularly
during the phase-in period of the NCVS questionnaire. (During the
completion of the NCVS phase-in during 1993, the number of sample
cases also changed monthly from January to June.) Consequently,
attempts to compare unweighted cases across years may produce
artifactual differences that are due to variations in sample size
and not to any underlying temporal changes in victimization
patterns. Weights compensate for these variations in sample size
across years. Any attempt to compare victimization counts and
patterns across time should utilize weighted data to eliminate
sample size variation as a confounding factor in the analysis.
Although the NCVS has a rotating panel design, it is important to
recognize that NCVS weights are cross-sectional, not longitudinal.
That is, they are intended to provide estimates that are
representative of the population of individuals and households at
the time an interview was taken. They do not adjust for changes in
the composition of any panel of NCVS respondents over time or for
panel attrition and should not be used for this purpose in any
analysis that involves controlling for these changes to a panel.

- Study 34650 Data-Year Files
Text:

CONSTRUCTING ADDITIONAL NCVS DATA FILES - DATA-YEAR FORMAT

This data collection includes 2012 NCVS data files constructed on a
collection-year basis. Data-year files for the previous year - 2011
- can be constructed by using the current files, the previous year's
files, and the statistical software syntax that follows.
A common use of the NCVS is to estimate victimization rates. These
rates can be estimated on both a collection-year and a data-year
basis. For either basis this involves determining estimates of the
number of households, the number of persons, and the number of
household and personal victimizations.

DATA-YEAR HOUSEHOLD FILE
Creating a 2011 data-year household file involves concatenating the
2011 and 2012 collection-year household files, subsetting the
resulting file to include only records for interviews conducted from
January 2011 through June 2012, and calculating the household
weight to reflect the households' time in sample.
In constructing the 2011 data-year household file records from
interviews conducted in January through June 2012 need to be
included along with records from interviews conducted in 2011. This
is because of the six-month restrospective interview period;
respondents interviewed in June of 2012 may report victimizations
that occurred in December 2011.
The household weight needs to be constructed such that it represents
the households' opportunity to report a crime incident. For example, a
household interviewed in June 2012 has an opportunity to report
crimes occurring in one month of 2011 - December. Whereas a
household interviewed in December of 2011 has an opportunity to
report crimes occurring in six months of 2011 - June through
November. Variable V2116 (HOUSEHOLD WEIGHT) is adjusted to reflect the
varying opportunities to report crime incidents based on the
households' time in the NCVS sample.
The SPSS code below is an example of how to prepare a data-year
household file.

not subsetted based on when the interviews were done. Rather, it is
subsetted based on the year that the incidents occurred. To create a
2011 data-year incident file only incidents occurring in 2011 are
selected.
The collection-year victimization weight does not need to be

- Study 34650 adjusted. However, to reinforce that this is now a data-year file a
new weight is created and specifically indicated data year.
Victimization rates published by BJS often exclude series crimes and
crimes committed outside of the U.S. This needs to be taken into
consideration to tie to BJS publications.

DATA-YEAR INCIDENT-LEVEL EXTRACT FILE
Data analysts are often interested in examining crime incidents
(victimization) while taking into consideration characteristics of the
person and the household. One way to do this is to prepend the
household and person variables that are related to the crime incident
records. This requires merging three files to create a Data-Year
Incident-Level Extract File.

The following example builds on the examples above. The files that are
used are already data-year files. Consequently the resulting extract
file will be a data-year file.

*--- BEGIN SPSS SYNTAX FOR CREATING A 2011 DATA-YEAR INCIDENT-LEVEL
EXTRACT FILE.
* Two merges are done. The first merges the household variables onto
* the person record using the YEARQ (YEAR AND QUARTER OF INTERVIEW)
* and IDHH (NCVS ID FOR HOUSEHOLDS) variables.
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

In the match files statement the "table" indicates that the
household file will be used as a one-to-many match. For example, a
given household record may match to several person records, and the
same household information will be copied onto all of the matching
person records. It is possible that a household will have no
matching person records. In these instances using a table
specification prevents creating a new record with only household
variables and no person variables. Thus the table specification
copies household variables onto all of the matching person records,
but it does not create a new record when there is not a match. This
issue is more prominent when merging household and person variables
onto crime incident records.

match files
/table = "household2011_DY.sav"
/file = "person2011_DY.sav"
/by YEARQ IDHH
.

* Now merge the "in-process" file (denoted by the asterisk) created
