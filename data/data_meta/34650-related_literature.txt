Presents estimates of nonfatal violent victimization (rape, sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated and simple assault) against persons age 12 or older
with disabilities from 2009 to 2012. Findings are based on the National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The report compares the victimization of
persons with and without disabilities living in noninstitutionalized
households, including distributions by age, race, sex, victims' types of
disabilities, and other victim characteristics. Data from the U.S. Census
Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2000 U.S. Standard
Population were used to estimate age-adjusted victimization rates.

Presents findings from 2008 to 2012 on the relationship between households
that were above or below the federal poverty level and nonfatal violent
victimization, including rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, and simple assault. This report examines the violent victimization
experiences of persons living in households at various levels of poverty,
focusing on type of violence, victim's race or Hispanic origin, and
location of residence. It also examines the percentage of violent
victimizations reported to the police by poverty level. Data are from the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on
nonfatal crimes, reported and not reported to the police, against persons
age 12 or older from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.
During 2012, about 92,390 households and 162,940 persons were interviewed
for the NCVS.

Examines victims' socio-emotional problems resulting from violent crime,
including moderate to severe distress, problems with family or friend
relationships, or problems at work or school. The report explores the
relationship between the socio-emotional response to crime and the
characteristics of the victim and the incident, such as the victim-offender
relationship, injury, weapon use, and demographic characteristics. It
examines the emotional and physical symptoms associated with socio-
emotional problems, and the association between victim help-seeking
behaviors and the experience of socio-emotional problems. Data are from the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on
nonfatal (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple
assault) victimization reported and not reported to the police.

Presents estimates on nonfatal domestic violence from 2003 to 2012.
Domestic violence includes victimization committed by current or former
intimate partners (spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends), parents, children,
siblings, and other relatives. This report focuses on the level and pattern
of domestic violence over time, highlighting selected victim and incident
characteristics. Incident characteristics include the type of violence, the
offender's use of a weapon, victim injury and medical treatment, and
whether the incident was reported to police. The report provides estimates
of acquaintance and stranger violence for comparison. Data are from the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on
nonfatal crimes reported and not reported to police. The NCVS is a self-
report survey administered every six months to persons age 12 or older from
a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.

Presents 2012 estimates of rates and levels of criminal victimization in
the United States. This bulletin includes violent victimization (rape or
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) and
property victimization (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and property theft).
It describes the annual change from 2011 and analyzes 10-year trends from
2003 through 2012. The bulletin includes estimates of domestic violence,
intimate partner violence, and injury and use of weapons in violent
victimization. It also describes the characteristics of victims. The
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) collects information on nonfatal
crimes, reported and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 or
older from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. During
2012, about 92,390 households and 162,940 persons were interviewed for the
NCVS.

Examines the feasibility of using direct variance estimation for the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). It compares generalized
variance function (GVF) estimates to two direct variance estimation methods
(Taylor Series Linearization and Balanced Repeated Replication). It also
provides recommendations for calculating confidence intervals and
identifying unstable estimates. A companion user' s guide has been
developed to describe how to implement the direct variance techniques
detailed in this report using different software packages.

Presents counts and rates of hate crime victimization in 2012, using data
from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The tables show change
in the number and rate of hate crime victimizations since 2011 and during
the 10-year period since 2003. They examine the perceived motivation for
the hate crime, demographic characteristics of victims and offenders, and
the percentage of hate crime reported to police. In addition, the tables
compare characteristics of hate crime and nonhate crime victimization, and
the NCVS and FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) hate crime statistics.
