Proposal v2 April 6

​

My updated question is something like this:

# What features are useful in predicting attempted assault on a person?

Or, more actively:

# I will minimize the threat to human suffering by predicting people most at risk and targeting them with crime-prevention techniques.

Assuming my accuracy is high enough to justify the cost of such crime-prevention campaigns, I could potentially save x_dollars in medical costs,

or x_dollars in property theft damages. I can compute x with the help of a confusion matrix and a cost-bennifit matrix. 

​

I have discovered that one of my files in my data set is a combination of all the other files, joined on date.

This will save me a big step in trying to combine all my info

​

​

I have started lite feature engineering, using ghraphlab's tree- boosting algorythm.

Using this, I can predict attempted aussualt with a gun, with a rmse of 0.23

proposal v1

​

I want to answer 'What kind of variable can predict whether a person will be a victim in a crime in the US?'

I will use graphlab, sklearn, and other libraries

I will show how I can predict people who are more likely to be victims,

I will show evidence of how targeted awareness campaignes can prevent crime

I will use AB testing and cost-profit matricies to show how maximizing my models predictive power can save lives and money

My next step is to clean my datasets and see if I can join multible tables together to feed into my algorythm.

(I haven't choosen an algorythm yet, but I think boosting would be a good start.)\

​

My Data is, "National Crime Victim Survey, 2012":
